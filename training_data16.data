affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
affect.v | 1 | He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives . Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy . American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't %% affect %% their relationships with the ad agency . `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
affect.v | 1 | Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to %% affect %% our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
allow.v | 1 | He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s . `` Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine , '' Mr. Boren says , referring as well to Sam Rayburn , the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower . `` They %% allowed %% this country to be credible . I really want to see that happen again . '' If this were 1949 , Mr. Boren might even succeed .
allow.v | 1 | The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . But it would %% allow %% considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .
allow.v | 1 | Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' %% allowing %% extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors . `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says .
allow.v | 1 | You only have a privilege to practice . '' DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would %% allow %% it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
allow.v | 1 | It also adds to the mystery of the venture . Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . `` Once people got into it , I was %% allowing %% them to live a dream , '' he says . He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says . `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . ''
allow.v | 1 | I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , %% allow %% psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now .
allow.v | 1 | Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame . He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed . `` Since when did they %% allow %% beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ? He asked . `` Seems to me I do n't remember altering any law about that '' . He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .
announce.v | 1 | Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a Washington priority . `` The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada 's membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , '' said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. . The Canadian application is expected to be %% announced %% in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . `` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada 's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization .
announce.v | 1 | `` The Famous Teddy Z , '' which CBS Inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged . Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may %% announce %% `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season . `` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen . `` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
announce.v | 1 | Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . Goodson also %% announced %% that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
announce.v | 1 | In Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . Estimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion . The baseball commissioner %% announced %% that the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would n't resume until Friday . THE U.S. . IS REQUIRED to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plans . Under guidelines included in an exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives .
announce.v | 1 | The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome . On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses . The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by %% announcing %% : `` Today I go see the horses '' . It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .
announce.v | 1 | More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband 's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to %% announce %% to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .
approve.v | 1 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also %% approved %% was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
approve.v | 1 | The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . '' Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . Use of dispersants was %% approved %% when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .
approve.v | 1 | Honecker 's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule . HUNGARY ADOPTED constitutional changes to form a democratic system . At a nationally televised legislative session in Budapest , the Parliament overwhelmingly %% approved %% changes formally ending one-party domination in the country , regulating free elections by next summer and establishing the office of state president to replace a 21-member council . The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary . Like other Soviet bloc nations , it had been known as a `` people 's republic '' since
area.n | 1 | `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . '' Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities . That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban %% areas %% . Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says Maurice Geiger , founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier , Vt. , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
area.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade %% areas %% , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
area.n | 1 | Stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds . One was that , despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due . The other is that he 's an Oakland native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit %% areas %% last week . Afterward , as the A 's toasted their victory with beer ( they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims ) , Stewart said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy . `` Give me four or five more Series with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young , '' he said , in reference to baseball 's best-pitcher award .
area.n | 1 | Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports . The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s , however , forcing the bank to face competition . At the same time , many of Spain 's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing %% areas %% faced a sharp decline in economic growth . As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .

Butch McCarty , who sells oil-field equipment for Davis Tool Co. , is also busy . A native of the %% area %% , he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience store . `` First year I came back there was n't any work , '' he says . `` I think it 's on the way back now .

European venture capital funds total about $ 14 billion and are expected to continue growing 35 % annually . Continentals believe that the strongest growth %% area %% will be southern Europe . Spain and Italy are most often mentioned as the future economic hot spots . Favored ventures include media , telecommunications and retailing .
area.n | 2 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all %% areas %% saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
area.n | 1 | The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay %% area %% officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
area.n | 2 | He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers . `` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says . `` They are n't prepared to compete in an %% area %% where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
area.n | 1 | These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city %% areas %% may represent a major new untapped market for investment . New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
area.n | 1 | CalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles %% area %% real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million . CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
area.n | 1 | But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much . Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria %% area %% and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December . For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
area.n | 1 | Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow . The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem . Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the %% area %% 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours . Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . ''
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
area.n | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion . The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up . William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay %% area %% , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product .

I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here . And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our %% area %% . And if we 're not ombudsman for our area , we ought to be thrown out of office . On the other hand , if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story .
area.n | 2 | But many investors remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers . `` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . `` I think the problems in the junk-bond %% area %% are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds . In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. DeVoe added . `` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''

Chiron was up 1\/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1\/2 to 16 3\/8 . The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved , too .
area.n | 1 | The calls reached many , but certainly not all , of the publicly held companies with operations in the area . In most cases damage to company facilities and operations was minimal . ADIA SERVICES INC. , Menlo Park , temporary personnel agency , annual sales of $ 504 million , OTC , said all 30 offices in Bay %% area %% were working , but in various states of disarray . Business was slow because many companies were closed yesterday . ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC. , Sunnyvale , integrated circuit maker , annual sales of $ 1.12 billion , NYSE , had only minor structural damage .
area.n | 2 | The comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain %% areas %% of wholesale banking . Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said .
ask.v | 2 | This month , the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium . Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war . The FDA has %% asked %% Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe . It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol . But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves .
ask.v | 1 | `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really %% asking %% is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ?

ask.v | 1 | State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed ( Drexel ) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and %% asked %% for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''
ask.v | 2 | Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . Washington rejected the bid , saying the hostages were n't linked to other issues . PLO leader Arafat %% asked %% Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula . Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from drugs to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . ''
ask.v | 2 | President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . Mr. Bush %% asked %% Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
ask.v | 1 | Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . He talked about 20 minutes . When he was through , the court members %% asked %% many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
ask.v | 2 | Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg . He `` legitimized '' Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles . Victor Berger , the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress , had %% asked %% Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English . Carl , who was stationed in Appleton , Wisconsin , organizing for the Social Democrats , was in Berger 's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar . She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton , Illinois .
ask.v | 1 | I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . And why not ? ? How , I %% asked %% , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ? If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .

Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' . `` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
ask.v | 2 | At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to %% ask %% Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
ask.v | 1 | The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and %% asked %% if there was anything he could do for them . Harold shook his head . `` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .
ask.v | 1 | So what ? ? Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ? ( he %% asked %% this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) . Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him . He could n't make out what he was saying .

But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , `` My father .
ask.v | 6 | He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps . The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America . `` Join me in another '' ? ? He had %% asked %% . `` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously . `` I do not drink so much '' .

ask.v | 1 | His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She %% asked %% him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
ask.v | 2 | I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , would n't it ? ? What she 'd said was true -- in all these years , she 'd never %% asked %% for anything from me . If I let her go , she 'd disappear once more . And Gladdy would be safe ! !
ask.v | 1 | A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . `` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll %% ask %% the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . There 's so little to do '' .
ask.v | 1 | Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town . Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine . Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , %% asked %% quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on . `` See for yourself , Miss Zion . It will n't take a minute '' .
ask.v | 1 | It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was %% asked %% whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ?
attempt.v | 1 | In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off . Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection ( taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies ) and to deny new credit to defaulters . These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that %% attempt %% to offset market imperfections . 3 . Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget . Since the budget measures cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back .
attempt.v | 1 | The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had %% attempted %% to make it a successorship by inheritance . It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation .
authority.n | 3 | Here are two cases to illustrate . Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car . The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the %% authorities %% carry them away . Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack . There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital .
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
authority.n | 3 | Revenue doubled from two years ago . That is , if the company reported results correctly . The Asahi Shimbun , a Japanese daily , last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax %% authorities %% over a two-year period . The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment , and Mr. Kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . The small , wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world .
authority.n | 3 | The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out . Dozens of workers were injured , %% authorities %% said . There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
authority.n | 3 | This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . In making cases , the %% authorities %% frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
authority.n | 1 | It 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs . For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it . Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois ( the first time that a state has used its educational facilities %% authority %% to support construction of a theater ) , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets . The rest , he is confident , can be raised . His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
avoid.v | 1 | `` The World Series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester , which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago . `` You 've got to judge where the network will be in three years . '' The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS ca n't %% avoid %% big losses on the sports coverage itself . And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc .
avoid.v | 1 | The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants . The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors %% avoid %% disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said . Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said . The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
avoid.v | 1 | This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby %% avoid %% the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .
avoid.v | 1 | She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . When there was bridge at Edythe 's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who 'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to %% avoid %% a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
base.n | 7 | Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people . Congress sent to Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % . The measure also moves more than $ 450 million in the Pentagon budget to home-state projects from foreign %% bases %% . U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases . The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons .

The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a %% base %% cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .

begin.v | 2 | He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring . Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , %% began %% months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage . They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells . Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .
begin.v | 1 | Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines . The disarray in the junk-bond market that %% began %% last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation 's largest law firms . While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past . Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour .

'' Cemetery officials hope the ads , which will %% begin %% airing next month , will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions . Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery . The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
begin.v | 2 | The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll . The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson . But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll %% began %% focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
begin.v | 2 | The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips . Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year . An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already %% beginning %% to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said . The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
begin.v | 1 | When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would %% begin %% producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
believe.v | 1 | As rescue teams continued searching for victims , hundreds of suvivors accused the government of a feeble response following the temblors . Britain 's Thatcher summoned senior advisers for strategy talks as opinion polls showed the prime minister 's popularity had hit a record low following the resignation last Thursday of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawson . One poll , conducted for the British Broadcasting Corp. , found that 52 % of voters %% believed %% that she should quit . Lawmakers in Hungary approved legislation granting amnesty to many people convicted of crimes punishable by less than three years in prison . They also established an office to control government and party finances .

Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla . I %% believe %% Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others . A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management . Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .

'' We do n't believe it . And we certainly do not %% believe %% that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it . Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself . The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing .

He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . Some auto executives %% believe %% the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels .
believe.v | 1 | That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing . Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette . The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts %% believe %% is partly responsible for its staid performance . Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 . Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .
believe.v | 1 | Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . For instance , some analysts %% believe %% bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past . Portfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio .
believe.v | 1 | The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa , with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress . But here in Morgenzon , a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal , the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady . The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands , a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- %% believe %% that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid , it 's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races . Here , then , is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand . Their idea is to create a city , first , and then an entire nation -- without blacks .
believe.v | 1 | The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They %% believe %% that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
believe.v | 1 | This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . And yet we obviously also %% believe %% that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?

believe.v | 1 | Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . As violently as possible . But he was so taken aback , he could not %% believe %% any rage of his would make her give in . On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . And if he surrendered after raving at her .
believe.v | 1 | I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not %% believe %% that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' .
bill.n | 3 | DRUG WARS : A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers ' licenses of some drug offenders . The %% bill %% would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
bill.n | 5 | Short-term rates also were mixed . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday 's auction to 7.79 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04 % . The discount rate on six-month Treasury %% bills %% fell slightly to 7.60 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99 % .

bill.n | 3 | The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion . A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits . And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the %% bill %% would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe . Separately , the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .
bill.n | 3 | Since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty . But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . The Thurmond %% bill %% would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated . Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage . The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire .
bill.n | 5 | And because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity . Because of the early settlement , the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account . However , analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury %% bills %% that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market . The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $ 2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday . Here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction :
bill.n | 3 | Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request . Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less , their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640 % and 430 % , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures . The swift passage of the %% bill %% , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs . By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration . The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today , raising all new cash . The %% bills %% will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 , No non-competitive tenders will be accepted . Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare , would n't be affected . Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity . And it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending %% bills %% rather than in the official bills themselves . Still , proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important `` chilling effect '' on all manner of appropriations bills . Lawmakers , they say , would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later .
bill.n | 3 | This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers . A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the %% bill %% , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
bill.n | 4 | In fact , six of those companies received refunds , which totaled $ 120 million . The lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments . This is the fifth year Citizens for Tax Justice has released a study on corporate tax %% bills %% . Earlier reports , which revealed that as many as 73 companies were avoiding income tax legally , have been credited with helping galvanize efforts to overhaul the tax code . But even though companies are paying more taxes , many are still paying less than the statutory rate , the report said .

The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed . Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the %% bill %% . In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . Daniel Brigham
bill.n | 3 | The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements . The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase . Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers , now says the %% bill %% would further disturb the jittery capital markets . Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . '' It is ironic that at a time when America 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia , so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline , Aeroflot .
bill.n | 3 | In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . ) Also last spring , Rep. Ron Dellums ( D. , Calif. ) , introduced a %% bill %% requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement . In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping . The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .

The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . By a lopsided 97-1 margin , the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the %% bill %% on a 303-107 roll call . The package is more than $ 1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week . But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations .
bill.n | 3 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying %% bill %% approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
bill.n | 4 | That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . There is an element of make-work involved . Consumers pay the %% bill %% for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car . If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .
bill.n | 5 | TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month %% bills %% at the regular weekly auction . Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
bill.n | 4 | Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts . Lawyers will benefit . Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge %% bill %% . The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
bill.n | 3 | But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the %% bill %% makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency . Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger . Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C. ) , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
bill.n | 5 | Short-term rates rose yesterday . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week %% bills %% yesterday . The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 . Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
bill.n | 3 | The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the %% bill %% are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt . The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market . `` It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort , '' Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee , said during the panel 's deliberations .
bill.n | 3 | Another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount . Since they have a lower interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility . The House version of the %% bill %% would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five . The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible . The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
bill.n | 3 | That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations %% bills %% . ( Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . ) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 14.1 billion in maturing %% bills %% . The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 , 1990 , and April 26 , 1990 , respectively . Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . It was the first time in 20 years that such government %% bills %% were defeated . In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power .
build.v | 1 | Some equipment going to work is almost new . Grace Energy just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from Caspar , Wyo. , to drill the Bilbrey well , a 15,000-foot , $ 1-million-plus natural gas well . The rig was %% built %% around 1980 , but has drilled only two wells , the last in 1982 . Until now it had sat idle . For Zel Herring , owner and a cook at the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for a very good year .
build.v | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will %% build %% a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .

We cruise toward another set of pilings . The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook .
build.v | 3 | With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it . But with every step I take , I 'm %% building %% wealth . You can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the bullet . So go out there and eat that debt .
build.v | 2 | In addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome . Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to %% build %% up inside . Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later .
build.v | 1 | It was a fortunate time in which to %% build %% , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .

buy.v | 1 | CBS pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges Thomas H. Wyman , who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9 % stake in the company and took over three years ago . `` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one . And they 've %% bought %% one . '' On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion . That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay .
buy.v | 1 | At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help %% buy %% a 45-acre horse farm . `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your horse , '' he says . But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
buy.v | 1 | It 's a real dog . '' Supermarkets are getting into the variety act , too . They still %% buy %% apples mainly for big , red good looks -- that 's why so many taste like woodchucks ' punching bags . But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples . `` Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis , '' says Chuck Tryon , perishables director for Super Valu Inc. , a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor .
buy.v | 1 | `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . `` The affluent people and the corporations can %% buy %% it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .

'' He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ 1.65 a pound , which was reached last year . In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had %% bought %% copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market . In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
buy.v | 6 | Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to %% buy %% out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
buy.v | 6 | Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to %% buy %% itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
buy.v | 1 | The air force is to take at least 250 more . Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to %% buy %% used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale . Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .
buy.v | 3 | The difference is magnified by time , too . At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate . Did I %% buy %% it ? Well , not yet . I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
buy.v | 3 | A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . The theory relies on three assumptions : 1 ) Voters can `` %% buy %% '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) . 3 ) Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . `` If working %% capital %% financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
capital.n | 1 | The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September . However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise %% capital %% , NRM said . In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change . Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
capital.n | 1 | Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline . A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the %% capital %% requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the `` core capital '' criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance . Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
capital.n | 1 | But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991 . To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created %% capital %% gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .
capital.n | 1 | Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce %% capital %% , entrepreneurs say . If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
capital.n | 1 | The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs . Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for %% capital %% spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .
capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .
capital.n | 1 | Those implications include : -- Privatization . Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance . Market-based pollution control may consume some %% capital %% that would otherwise purchase state industries . But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . -- Least-cost solutions .

Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the %% capital %% of Mogadishu . Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
capital.n | 1 | The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 . `` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up %% capital %% . At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
capital.n | 2 | Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's %% capital %% of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
capital.n | 1 | Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month . Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign %% capital %% , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .
capital.n | 1 | Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline . The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose . If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's %% capital %% , then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative . Mr. Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress .

I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling .

That would make him mad enough if he was sober .

And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch %% cared %% . Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .

At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; ; neither did he %% care %% that Aunt Rose provided for him . He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .

carrier.n | 4 | Baker 's remarks came as the White House urged both sides to honor the truce . The USS Lexington returned to dock in Pensacola , Fla. , following an accident Sunday in which the pilot of a training jet crashed into the ship , killing five sailors . The captain of the aircraft %% carrier %% , the oldest in the Navy , said the flier was making his first attempt to land on a carrier . Four people torched three U.S. flags on the central steps of the U.S. Capitol in a bid to test a new federal law protecting the American flag from desecration . All four demonstrators were arrested .
carrier.n | 6 | `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % . Delta has benefited more than other %% carriers %% from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub . Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter . Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
carrier.n | 6 | There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal . Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other %% carriers %% -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
carrier.n | 6 | Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . The %% carrier %% has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
carrier.n | 6 | But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs . Under the committee bill , the Transportation secretary would have 30 days , and an additional 20 days if needed , to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock . The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the %% carrier %% 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
carrier.n | 6 | StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas . StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada . The %% carrier %% has n't yet turned a profit .
carrier.n | 8 | One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive , a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co . Formed in August , the venture weds AT&T 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express 's Omaha , Neb. , service center . Other long-distance %% carriers %% have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool . Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television . The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years .
cause.v | 1 | In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices . The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could %% cause %% a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
cause.v | 1 | The five astronauts returned to Earth about three hours early because high winds had been predicted at the landing site . Fog shrouded the base before touchdown . Explosions shook a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near Pasadena , Texas , hurling debris and %% causing %% a fire visible from 10 miles away . More than 100 people were injured , and a number of workers were missing . Parts of the Houston Ship Channel were closed .
cause.v | 1 | He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what %% causes %% sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said .
cause.v | 1 | Open your heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray ! ! For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire '' . Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they %% caused %% him to tremble . For he feared the Lake of Fire . He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; ; he must pray to be spared .
chance.n | 1 | Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more . And not just for the players . It 's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the %% chance %% to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers . `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics . Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments .
chance.n | 1 | If this battle were a movie , the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common . In the opener , Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $ 5 billion . Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the %% chance %% to run Columbia . Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner . That 's where the two scripts would diverge .
chance.n | 1 | Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . Mr. Breeden , not missing a %% chance %% to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange .
chance.n | 4 | The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending . The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion . `` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a %% chance %% , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president . Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories . But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
chance.n | 1 | When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the %% chance %% . Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
chance.n | 4 | Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony . `` It 's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station . You might find something , but the %% chances %% are low , '' said Michael Ellman , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co . And Eugene Glazer , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a ( prediction ) of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , infringed on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass .
claim.v | 2 | Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value %% claimed %% by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid . Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge . A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
claim.v | 1 | But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined . Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability . It %% claims %% the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far . The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller ( D. , Calif. ) , a sponsor of the bill .
claim.v | 1 | You know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General . In his own words , Bang-Jensen ' took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public . He %% claimed %% that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' '' . Gross bristled . For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .
come.v | 3 | The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves . In recent months , researchers have %% come %% to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
come.v | 1 | Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up . Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives , including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked to see the future . Even the Soviet Union %% came %% , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model . Here 's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw . New Technology
come.v | 9 | The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that %% came %% to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
come.v | 6 | The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw : row upon row of greenhouses , stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners ' wealth . Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken . Grain , milk and meat %% come %% next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast . Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .
come.v | 2 | Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . The tip-off %% came %% when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
come.v | 4 | `` If the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers %% came %% out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''
come.v | 1 | The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong . Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected . Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to %% come %% . `` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co . `` Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9 % -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . ''
come.v | 1 | However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % . Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to %% come %% in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
come.v | 1 | He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , %% came %% on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
come.v | 5 | Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
come.v | 2 | Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war . The talks %% came %% as Lebanese negotiations on political changes appeared deadlocked . GOP Sen. Specter of Pennsylvania said he would vote to acquit federal Judge Alcee Hastings in his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and bribery conspiracy . Specter , the vice chairman of the Senate 's evidence panel , said there was `` insufficient evidence to convict '' the Miami jurist .
come.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost %% came %% to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
complain.v | 1 | But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars . Critics have %% complained %% that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains . In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . '' The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
complain.v | 1 | The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he %% complained %% , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean . Scrub the studio once a week .
complete.v | 1 | Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government %% completed %% a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members . Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines . The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .
complete.v | 1 | General Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $ 400 million power plant , which is being built in Burrillville , R.I . GE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . The second portion will be %% completed %% the following year . GE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion .
condition.n | 1 | DRUG WARS : A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers ' licenses of some drug offenders . The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a %% condition %% of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
condition.n | 2 | As part of the transaction , Edisto agreed to give Mesa , an Amarillo , Texas , oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr. , a seat on its board . NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto . The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other %% conditions %% . NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .
condition.n | 1 | The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities . Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market %% conditions %% turn sour . If that proves true , analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992 , when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers . With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor .
condition.n | 1 | New Technology The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road %% conditions %% and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
condition.n | 1 | Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts . The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective . A Carbide spokesman said `` the %% conditions %% are right for the increase to hold . '' For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense . Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
condition.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary %% conditions %% . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
condition.n | 1 | `` There is n't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect , '' said John Reidy , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research , Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth . It cited cyclical %% conditions %% in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units . For the nine months , net income rose 19 % to $ 449 million , or $ 2.40 a share , from $ 375.9 million , or $ 2.01 a share , a year earlier . Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of $ 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International .

Valhi said the articles did n't accurately reflect Valhi and its affiliates ' intentions toward Lockheed . Instead , Valhi said , they may increase , decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings , depending on a number of %% conditions %% .
condition.n | 1 | In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish they could . As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline , the unsettled %% conditions %% will frighten many investors . `` The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , '' says Henry Linsert Jr. , chairman of Martek Corp. , a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock . `` The more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain . ''
contribute.v | 2 | Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have %% contributed %% to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .
contribute.v | 2 | You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' . Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not %% contribute %% to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears . Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
defense.n | 1 | In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment . But last February , a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense . The appeals court said the %% defense %% is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision . General Dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely . General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
defense.n | 2 | Step 1 cleans up our books . Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion . Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year %% Defense %% Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan 's final budget submission to Congress . That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion . To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion .
defense.n | 1 | `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week 's interview . He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position . But there is no %% defense %% at all for the ethos of the 1980s . We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989 : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
defense.n | 5 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital %% defense %% goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
defense.n | 4 | During the balloting , 26 members of the 500-seat Parliament voted against Krenz , a move considered unprecedented in the country 's 40-year history . Officials in East Berlin , responding to complaints from opposition groups , admitted police used excessive force in dispersing protesters this month . The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the %% defense %% . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake .

For the nine months , the electronics and %% defense %% concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period . Sales were $ 4.66 billion , up 1.3 % from $ 4.6 billion . Jerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
defense.n | 7 | Nine-month net fell 9.5 % to $ 323.4 million , or $ 1.36 a share , from $ 357.2 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier . Revenue dropped 5.4 % to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.68 billion . This year 's nine-month results include gains of $ 13 million , or five cents a share , from the sale of Schlumberger 's %% defense %% systems business , and $ 22 million , or nine cents a share , from an award by the IranU.S . Claims Tribunal . The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $ 35 million , or 13 cents a share , from sale of the company 's Electricity Control & Transformers division .
describe.v | 1 | For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses . Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a Farmers spokesman said . Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which he %% described %% as `` peanuts .

'' That 's not fair ; they 're not all fat .
describe.v | 1 | Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by %% describing %% in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .
describe.v | 1 | `` O ! ! Pioneers ! ! '' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to %% describe %% how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .

The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and %% development %% , Mr. Lane said . The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said . Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time .
development.n | 1 | And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ? An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market . For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the %% development %% of a free market . Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council ) . Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
development.n | 1 | P&G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition . Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics . That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product %% development %% will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands . `` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal . `` You 'll see fewer gimmicks .

development.n | 1 | On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them . `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co.

Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year . `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .

The OAS , which tries to promote peace and economic %% development %% within the Americas , is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis . Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership , but the organization 's members are discussing Cuba 's reinstatement .

And other developers may shift from commercial to residential %% development %% in the U.S. . `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago , '' says Charles Shaw , a Chicago-based real estate developer . `` So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties .

It said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover . `` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and %% development %% in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research . Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville , Calif .

development.n | 1 | It earned $ 76.4 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 quarter . General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales . Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 %% development %% dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Northrop shares closed at $ 21.125 , off 25 cents . General Dynamics closed at $ 54.875 , up 50 cents .
development.n | 1 | Great American Bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law . The proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow Great American to continue engaging in real estate %% development %% activities , it said . Those activities generated $ 26.1 million in operating profit last year . But according to Great American , such profits do n't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law .

John Mack promptly quit his job last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over Mr. Mack 's violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old . After a few weeks in seclusion , Mr. Mack opened a consulting firm , but not to enable him to directly lobby ; that would require him to %% disclose %% his clients by registering as a lobbyist .

But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue . Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale .
disclose.v | 1 | Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $ 1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $ 10,000,000 ( we do n't %% disclose %% financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; ; and no limitation is in evidence . Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .

Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed . The producers , he says , did a good job of depicting someone `` who had %% done %% so much , but who was also a manic-depressive .
do.v | 1 | If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out . As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually %% done %% anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . ) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze 's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair .

Bloomingdale 's %% does %% an estimated $ 1.2 billion in annual sales . The sale of Bloomingdale 's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $ 800 million in bridge financing for Campeau , which disclosed last month that its retailing units , Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. , were strapped for cash . O&Y , owned by Toronto 's Reichmann family , is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau , a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company .

A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift , hoping to rebuild it .

But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has %% done %% a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .

do.v | 1 | Like which are droppable and which are not . With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers . But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who %% did %% the Katzenjammer Kids . ( In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . ) `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .

do.v | 1 | All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads . `` The { ministry } thinks the banks do n't know what they are %% doing %% , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified . `` The { ministry } wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added . Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .

But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you %% doing %% planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .

drug.n | 1 | Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects , Lancet , the British medical journal , reported in 1987 . However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys . The %% drug %% has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it . All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion . A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486 .
drug.n | 1 | Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan . Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992 . Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic %% drugs %% and veterinary products . Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. Bergsma said . Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .

Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter . In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A.

A crusade of NO to the consumption of %% drugs %% is imperative . Mr. Cano is president of El Espectador , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
drug.n | 1 | The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the %% drug %% 's usage for adults in March 1987 . But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
drug.n | 2 | This is not the case . The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative . It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI 's role would be to continue targeting the major %% drug %% traffickers through our National Drug Strategy . Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market . The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
drug.n | 2 | He acknowledged , however , that Washington 's `` drug-related murder rate is intolerably high . The prisons are too crowded . %% Drugs %% continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects .

But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
drug.n | 1 | In addition , Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores . Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients . `` We believe that every %% drug %% that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a Ralph Nader affiliate . Dr. Teich said Searle is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available . According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
drug.n | 1 | A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh , according to researchers . The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration , and its long-term effects are unknown . But researchers say the %% drug %% , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates . Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year . Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .

'' Even at this early stage , %% drugs %% caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .

All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material %% effect %% on the company 's strategic plan . '' Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim .
effect.n | 1 | Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined . The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting %% effect %% on either Boeing or its work force . The company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared with $ 53.6 billion at the end of Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ 5 billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 .

The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the %% effects %% of tax-rate reduction on capital flows . Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan .
effect.n | 3 | Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take %% effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo . But whatever its %% effects %% on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand . Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s . Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
effect.n | 1 | -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero %% effect %% on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers . There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .

Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He said that ill %% effects %% from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said .

The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans . The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of Mexico 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into %% effect %% in early China 's top film actress , Liu Xiaoqing , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in Shandong province , the People 's Daily reported .

Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations , but interest and principal are paid in dollars . The bonds %% ended %% about 1\/2 point higher yesterday . Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined . West Germany 's 7 % issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01 % , while the 6 3\/4 % issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33 % .

New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday . As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week %% ended %% Oct. 19 .
end.v | 1 | Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change . Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz . Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II %% ended %% . Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .

The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures %% ends %% with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff . They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace . Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .

A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which %% enjoy %% considerable backing from the Japanese government . Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .

In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed . In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to %% enjoy %% conversing with me in rudimentary phrases . Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things . For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .

The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed . The institute did n't %% estimate %% annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 . The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .

'' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to %% estimate %% how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .

Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are %% estimated %% at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million . Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November .

The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans %% estimates %% that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range . The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .

Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington %% estimated %% that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag .
examine.v | 1 | In this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community . An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence . If we %% examine %% the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke . The first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society . The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .

No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was %% examined %% , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
exchange.n | 3 | But in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said , `` We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation . Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades . He said he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program trading and the %% exchange %% 's role in it that has raged in recent days . Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some investors want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . '' The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that .
exchange.n | 5 | These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions . In an interest-rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period . In a forward-rate agreement , a client agrees to an %% exchange %% rate on a future currency transaction . Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem . Started three years ago , Chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field .
exchange.n | 3 | Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l , 1975 . The timing for change was right . Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought %% exchange %% seats to handle their own trades . And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets . Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of 35 % to 60 % below pre-May 1 levels .
exchange.n | 5 | As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . To keep the %% exchange %% rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
exchange.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil futures marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the %% exchange %% falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange . On Friday , the Merc 's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co. 's Henry Hub in Erath , La. , as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract . It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York %% exchanges %% have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . So far there is little to show for such efforts .
exchange.n | 3 | On Friday , Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia 's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore . The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say . Though the split has long been expected , the %% exchanges %% are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways . The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries . Rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .
exchange.n | 3 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the %% exchanges %% might be closed . He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
exchange.n | 3 | When the going gets tough , it 's tough to trade stocks in continental Europe . That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence . They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European %% exchanges %% trade stocks . The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on London 's stock exchange , which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries . `` I 'm not saying London covered itself in glory , but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses , '' says Stewart Gilchrist , a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which manages about # 6 billion ( $ 9.63 billion ) in institutional money .
exchange.n | 5 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed %% exchange %% rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .

All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp. , which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year .
exchange.n | 3 | The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago %% exchange %% 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
exchange.n | 5 | The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , `` as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . '' Overseas sales were stronger , principally because of a rebound in Brazil , where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results , Johnson & Johnson said . Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable %% exchange %% rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter . He cautioned , however , that a `` tough tax-rate comparison '' may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter . For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said .

exchange.n | 3 | Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . The magnitude of the %% exchange %% 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
exchange.n | 1 | It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents . Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from %% exchange %% agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .
exchange.n | 3 | The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign %% exchange %% market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . Late in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York . The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday .

Most of those markets had rebounded the day before from Monday 's slide . But unlike the Tokyo %% exchange %% , they failed to extend the rise to a second session . Elsewhere , prices surged for a second day in Frankfurt , closed higher in Zurich , Stockholm and Amsterdam and were broadly lower in Milan , Paris and Brussels . South African gold stocks ended marginally firmer .
exchange.n | 3 | In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange . The decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake . The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the %% exchange %% could be traded today and tomorrow . SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market . Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .

In Chicago yesterday , Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific %% exchange %% options . The firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange '' even if the exchange is closed , said Wayne Luthringshausen , chairman of Options Clearing .

In the interview , Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector , but `` in the long run , I do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars . '' Roberto Morelli , Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London , said that right now `` the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news , '' referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock %% exchanges %% this week .

Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. %% exchanges %% , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .

'' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already %% exist %% `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
exist.v | 1 | He needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion . And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself . He must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not %% exist %% as man . Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' . This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain 's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' .

explain.v | 1 | While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it %% explains %% why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .
explain.v | 1 | When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities .

feel.v | 1 | Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible . The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable . For the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must %% feel %% represented . One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency . As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
feel.v | 1 | He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million . The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . But in general , all foreign-trading companies are %% feeling %% the pinch . `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
feel.v | 1 | The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they %% felt %% extended to them by the mother country . And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
feel.v | 1 | 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were %% felt %% with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe %% felt %% a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago . The New England conscience became desensitized .
feel.v | 1 | Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it . `` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not %% feel %% entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' . With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
feel.v | 2 | Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we could n't get in ? ? Suppose I had n't brought along enough money ? ? I %% felt %% for my wallet . Its thick , substantial outline calmed me . But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong .
feel.v | 1 | Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He %% felt %% a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
feel.v | 3 | Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school . He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry . Kate %% felt %% she had deserted the boy in her own loss . She loved him and missed his company . Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .
feel.v | 1 | We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . Whatever we %% felt %% about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming . The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .
feel.v | 1 | He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . Still , the sensation always surprised him . It was a thrill he %% felt %% no part in . He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things . He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
feel.v | 1 | This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh -- a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . Mercer got the blissful needle . When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he %% felt %% the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body . He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
feel.v | 1 | Such a pitiful end '' ! ! Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded . The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't %% feel %% privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady . Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives . So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .
feel.v | 1 | He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg %% felt %% himself developing a case of claustrophobia . The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in . If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
feel.v | 1 | Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed . Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ? Pamela %% felt %% calm and peaceful as she walked along . The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear . She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
feel.v | 1 | On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age . %% Feeling %% suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human . Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
feel.v | 1 | I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance . It was no use . I %% felt %% myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .
feel.v | 1 | I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night 's melancholy . My head was clear . I was hungry as a wolf , and my body %% felt %% lean and vital . `` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .
feel.v | 1 | She stood , once more listening . She had never been here at this hour . She %% felt %% as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her . If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .
feel.v | 1 | If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . I love you , I hate you , I %% feel %% like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you 're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . So I went about my business . I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
feel.v | 1 | It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing . He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day . So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , %% feeling %% . If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever . You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .
feel.v | 1 | He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again . Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank . Mr. Robards laughed , said he 'd %% feel %% a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her . `` You could try . And if I ever hear you say ' Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .
find.v | 1 | The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass . Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have %% found %% that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies . The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer . The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
find.v | 1 | The session failed to enact any new curbs . Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape . Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration %% finds %% itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
find.v | 3 | `` But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family . '' The opening credits are being redone , Mr. Nelson said , `` to make Teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning . Those viewers %% find %% the show confusing .
find.v | 3 | It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more . It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes . It is also the kind of libel politicians %% find %% useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency . But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
find.v | 1 | `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added . `` Magazines could , like other brands , %% find %% that they have only a limited life . '' There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling . More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .
find.v | 5 | The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
find.v | 1 | More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds , such as a $ 100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year . Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months . A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator , Mr. Fazio nonetheless %% found %% himself burdened not only by California 's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel . The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $ 100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina . California 's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position , too .
find.v | 1 | It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do . Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives . Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora %% finds %% an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold . While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom . In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
find.v | 1 | AG is hardly alone in its anxiety . A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once-stately insurance business . Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to %% find %% partners and preparing for price wars . In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
find.v | 1 | The rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . As rescuers pressed their efforts after %% finding %% a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . In Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . Estimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion .
fix.v | 3 | Based on historical rates of return , Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century . But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . And they 're leaning more toward %% fixed %% income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work , '' says Mr. Anderson . What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ?

future.n | 1 | The judge wrote again . `` I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report . `` Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel bank in the near %% future %% , I may be inclined to reconsider your request ... . '' The judge now says it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to extort there . '' The bank acquiesced .

future.n | 3 | Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , the leading Wall Street firm in the home-equity securities market , which was created early this year . Municipal Issues The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the New York City sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond %% futures %% continued to grow more negative . The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand . December municipal futures ended up 11\/32 point to 92-14 , having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded .
future.n | 3 | Separately , Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security . Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for %% futures %% than for stocks . Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility . These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .
future.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil %% futures %% marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the exchange falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange .
future.n | 3 | The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. %% futures %% exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision . Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are . The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
future.n | 3 | The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures . A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index %% futures %% rivals that in the stocks themselves . The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
future.n | 3 | It 's too disruptive , '' he says . `` It is n't investing . '' But stock-index %% futures %% have plenty of support . Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
future.n | 3 | `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader . `` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo . '' Average daily volume in S&P 500 %% futures %% last year was 44,877 contracts . Based on yesterday 's closing price of the S&P , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ 7.6 billion . By contrast , average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $ 5.3 billion .
future.n | 3 | The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . But owning index %% futures %% is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
future.n | 3 | Despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is likely to start slowly . The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled . Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its %% futures %% market . And Mr. Gilmore cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency . He says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day .
future.n | 3 | Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength . A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices . Wheat %% futures %% prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis . Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment . As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .
future.n | 4 | The group , which has held half a dozen seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers . `` People in this business have been insulated , '' says Josh Pons , a horse breeder from Bel Air , Md . `` But the real %% future %% of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses . '' At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch .
future.n | 3 | `` There was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P %% futures %% in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath . Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index . The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 3 | In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market . In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil %% futures %% yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a barrel for December delivery . Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking .
future.n | 3 | Friday 's Market Activity Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading . Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks . But there were fewer price swings than expected . Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange .
future.n | 1 | Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable %% future %% . '' However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .

But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the %% future %% , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history . The broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
future.n | 3 | The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 . Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index %% futures %% and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
future.n | 1 | But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts . `` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said . `` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the %% future %% and that means rate increases . '' Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed . Safeco fell 1\/8 to 32 5\/8 on 462,900 shares .
future.n | 3 | But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets . Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and %% futures %% . Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets .
future.n | 3 | After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index %% futures %% pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .

Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals . `` It 's just %% going %% to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs { the Warsaw Pact 's } , '' says one NATO analyst . So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed . They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude .

go.v | 2 | No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . `` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner says . `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're %% gone %% . '' During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks . Last October , during the 1988 Summer Games , NBC relentlessly pitched a new series , `` Tattingers . ''
go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .

I 'm %% going %% to have to get another job this year just to eat . '' Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs . Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer .
go.v | 1 | Garry Kasparov %% went %% to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack .
go.v | 14 | Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses . For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions . Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank %% goes %% about development , financial markets have confidence in it . This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms . Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
go.v | 7 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're %% going %% to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .

Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . `` On the other hand , we have economic news that is { expected to be } relatively positive for the bond market . We will %% go %% back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
go.v | 1 | David Baltimore , who has just been named president of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to %% go %% through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name . The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .
go.v | 1 | But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing . `` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . `` Cathay would love to keep %% going %% , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
go.v | 7 | Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? `` You 're not %% going %% to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
go.v | 14 | The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . Franchisees ca n't be forced to %% go %% along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
go.v | 1 | Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . Smith-Kline Beecham %% goes %% further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .
go.v | 4 | `` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . He is sitting in his living room , beneath a huge portrait of his late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 . Somewhere , the son sighs , things %% went %% terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation . `` People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it . But my father meant it to mean real separation , '' says the son .
go.v | 2 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon %% went %% away , while the shah -- he kept coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
grant.v | 2 | When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I %% grant %% , has a definite place in our society . But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .
hold.v | 5 | Under the direction of its new chairman , Francisco Luzon , Spain 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization . The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior . The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , %% holds %% 8.42 % . The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .
hold.v | 2 | The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion . Despite the widening gap between the two sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference . That would %% hold %% spending on the program at about the previous year 's level . The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin ( D. , Wis . ) . As the head of the House conferees , Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production .
hold.v | 4 | Medieval philosophers used to %% hold %% the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
hold.v | 5 | For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion . Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month . As of Aug. 31 , thrifts %% held %% $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities . The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
hold.v | 8 | The House Appropriations Committee approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the quake region , less than the $ 3.8 billion sought by California officials . Hungary declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the Soviet Union . A crowd estimated at 100,000 %% held %% a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman said .
hold.v | 5 | That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam %% held %% a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .
hold.v | 5 | Lep Group PLC of Britain , which %% holds %% a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . It noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .

The Bush administration accused Israeli Prime Minister Shamir of hindering peace efforts in the Mideast with `` unhelpful '' and disappointing statements . Shamir said Tuesday that he was prepared to risk a policy conflict with the U.S. over an Egyptian plan to %% hold %% direct Israeli-Palestinian talks , which the premier 's Likud bloc opposes . Cuba was elected to the U.N. Security Council for the first time since its Castro-led revolution 30 years ago . The election was by secret ballot in the General Assembly .
hope.v | 1 | Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring . And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded . Two bills in Congress %% hope %% to make such restrictions national . In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . )

The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .
hope.v | 1 | Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel %% hope %% to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .

He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . He had %% hoped %% to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him . Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .

She had spent too many hours looking ahead , %% hoping %% and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness . And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all .

It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama , about an %% hour %% outside Tokyo . The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year . The centerpiece of that complex , the Landmark Tower , will be Japan 's tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .

While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even %% hours %% . The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market . They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago .

The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market . West Germany 's biggest union , IG Metall , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter %% hours %% with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries .

hour.n | 1 | The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock . The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps . The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a `` massive buying effort '' as UAL jumped $ 20 a share to $ 170 in the last half %% hour %% , said Mr. Bates . With 15 seconds of trading to go , Mr. Jacobson , with what voice he had left , announced to the trading mob : `` We 're going to trade one price on the bell . '' That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds , as a way of making sure that last-second orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers .

Computer-generated videos help . `` The average American watches seven %% hours %% of TV a day . They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer . Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this .
hour.n | 2 | UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading %% hours %% Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid . But the board said it was n't interested for now .

Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . The shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several %% hours %% earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif .

Commonwealth leaders issued a declaration giving South Africa six months to deliver on pledges to ease apartheid or face new reprisals .
hour.n | 2 | Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees `` felt abandoned by the former owners , '' says the University of Florida sociologist . But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds , like expense-account fudging and phone misuse . Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura , Calif. , thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch %% hours %% and increased absenteeism , conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts . New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty . Most important , experts say , is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top .
hour.n | 1 | Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact . Tuesday night , thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel . Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an %% hour %% normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows , an FAA spokeswoman said . While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton , Calif. ; Reno and Las Vegas , Nev. ; and Los Angeles . United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
hour.n | 1 | The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses . Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures . But while the Merc reopened a half %% hour %% later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade . Exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .
improve.v | 1 | Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to %% improve %% the operation of capital markets . For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .

This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . The center %% improves %% the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . An additional benefit is the creation of jobs . This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
job.n | 2 | Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their %% jobs %% . Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers .
job.n | 1 | Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. counts under 39,000 workers , down 100 from the start of the year and off 8,500 from after its merger and the market collapse two years ago . Another major firm has cut 6,000 workers , 13 % of its staff , since Black Monday . The Bureau of Labor Statistics says securities firms in New York City alone have slashed 17,000 %% jobs %% from the December 1987 peak of 163,000 . Average annual earnings of those who have hung on , though , surged to $ 78,625 last year from $ 69,553 in 1987 . Any hiring is confined to retail sales .

Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130 % in less than two years , the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk . `` There 's a distinct possibility that I may lose my %% job %% over this , '' the employee , Karen Allen , of Floor Covering Resources , Kensington , Md. , recently told a congressional hearing . She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment .

job.n | 1 | Finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of Waertsilae Marine Oy , a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week , amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted . At stake are almost 10,000 %% jobs %% in an industry that has been the mainstay of Finland 's post-war economic revival . Shipbuilding became a point of pride as Finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over Europe . But if , as many now fear , Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on Finland 's international reputation .

The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 %% jobs %% , 95,400 of them in the tourist industry . Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms . Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage .

In fact , it 's barely begun for Mr. Corry , who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new %% job %% . `` He 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own , '' says Bryan Jacoboski , a securities analyst at PaineWebber Inc . The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive .

Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's %% job %% classifications into Federal 's . Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers .

The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . All told , Mr. Parker does a better %% job %% of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . But there are grounds for complaint .

Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . She says it 'd create 600 %% jobs %% and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''
job.n | 2 | Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . `` If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? '' She said , `` I would say K mart 's number one %% job %% is to address its market-share loss { in discount stores } , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins . At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' But K mart 's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses .

That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and %% joined %% with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government . But by the time Solidarity took office in September , the damage was done . `` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
join.v | 2 | Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to %% join %% the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .

In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras %% joined %% under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor .

The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .
keep.v | 1 | Still , some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are %% keeping %% mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` European companies are looking to buy American ones , '' said Henry King , the managing partner at that firm . `` But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions .

keep.v | 4 | Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer . Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always %% keep %% the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples .

'' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
keep.v | 1 | Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already ! We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we %% keep %% disposing of it . Bank it ? Not really !

The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
keep.v | 1 | She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she %% kept %% herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .
keep.v | 4 | Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade . He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to %% keep %% it from blowing in his eyes . Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below .
keep.v | 2 | He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean 's affections from her .

keep.v | 5 | If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he %% keep %% the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
keep.v | 1 | Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be %% kept %% dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
keep.v | 8 | `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to %% keep %% up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
keep.v | 3 | Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it was n't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . But I must n't start on Alice . She is a closed book , a picture I %% keep %% on my bureau , but never look at . If she 'd kept on as she 'd been going , the story I 'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , Gladdy 's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .

keep.v | 4 | Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home . However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to %% keep %% my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . When I arrived at Viola 's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook 's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .

Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially %% kill %% all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara .
kill.v | 1 | Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . `` When elephants start fighting , ants get %% killed %% , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
kill.v | 1 | No one would question such an errand . The bottle was filled up with flour . Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been %% killed %% . Now it would have another death . From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry .

kill.v | 1 | I meant him no harm . I 've given willful hurt to no man . I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he 's going to %% kill %% me . Beat me to death in front of a hundred people . Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .
kill.v | 1 | The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . I 'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to %% kill %% it at last , for it could never live . The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . `` It 's a big snake , is n't it '' ? ? He said .
lead.v | 1 | Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer . Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too . Where these discoveries will %% lead %% , scientists can only speculate . Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies . Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
lead.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could %% lead %% to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .

Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said %% leading %% advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group .

It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would %% lead %% a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
lead.v | 2 | MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering .

lead.v | 4 | Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . `` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has %% led %% Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . `` The Americans have left him without a way out . It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
lead.v | 1 | The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( C ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank . These assumptions %% lead %% to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel . The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men . This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .

Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney . Mrs. Hewlitt %% led %% the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout . Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life .
lead.v | 4 | Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century . He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's . %% Led %% by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him . Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .

The view of some others in Big Oil , he %% maintains %% , `` is very much { similar to } Amoco 's outlook . '' Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations . Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun .
maintain.v | 1 | Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom %% maintain %% close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
maintain.v | 1 | If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that . Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is %% maintained %% for 10 years . But Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies . And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
maintain.v | 2 | Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never %% maintained %% that sex was all . Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .

Secondly , the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications . Finally , Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller 's %% management %% beyond taking a place on the board . `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi . Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
management.n | 2 | The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment . Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender . Many analysts question %% management %% 's credibility . `` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but { because } the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth . Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down .
management.n | 2 | Three years later , machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire . Once again the company 's future looked less than rosy . But after restructuring under new %% management %% , the profits began rolling in . A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks . They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad .
management.n | 1 | Late Thursday , the Treasury said it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week . Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management bills . Instead , the Treasury announced it would sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash %% management %% bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today , as usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday . By moving the settlement date ahead , the Treasury can raise money under the $ 2.87 trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow , after which it reverts to $ 2.8 trillion . The market also was hurt by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru , a Japanese brokerage firm , was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased .
management.n | 2 | CMS ENERGY Corp. said %% management %% would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year .

management.n | 1 | Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired . Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money %% management %% unit 's contributions in recent years . In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million . Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
management.n | 1 | The acquisition was completed in September . In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .

Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the %% management %% contract .

management.n | 2 | When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy %% management %% consultants . `` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
management.n | 2 | The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL %% management %% . British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier . The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
management.n | 2 | UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase . Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake . UAL %% management %% was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake . The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing . Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .

Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its %% move %% as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992 . Yet the Rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision .

When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will %% need %% to convert its Manville stock to cash . But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares .

Under its revised fleet plan , PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year .
order.n | 6 | National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost %% orders %% following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .
order.n | 1 | The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law . The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week . They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court %% orders %% seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial . But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
order.n | 6 | That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York . She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the %% orders %% total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
order.n | 6 | A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall . That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts say they think durable goods %% orders %% fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout .
order.n | 6 | Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders . More stop-loss %% orders %% were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year . She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range .
order.n | 1 | CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup . The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point . `` The interpretation '' of the executive %% order %% , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . '' In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA . The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
order.n | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under %% orders %% to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .
order.n | 6 | A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . Limit Order : Limit %% orders %% are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
order.n | 6 | The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit %% orders %% turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
order.n | 6 | Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the %% order %% is automatically canceled . Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says .
order.n | 6 | For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . `` Day %% orders %% '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .
order.n | 4 | His steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney . `` We have the structure , people and plan , '' Mr. Isler said in a statement . Now , the first %% order %% of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $ 3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a Cup challenge . The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull . In September , a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
order.n | 1 | In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new %% order %% has n't arrived without resistance . Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations . Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners .
order.n | 6 | Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls . `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said Navin Vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily volume of about 10 million shares . Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting %% orders %% to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles , `` business is as usual '' Mr. Vyas said . `` If one city is down , the other can take over . '' Meanwhile , the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope .
order.n | 6 | The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer . Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988 . The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain %% orders %% in cooperation with another trader , David Stein . The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years . Also , he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $ 35,000 to a customer .
order.n | 6 | While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer %% orders %% . The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration .
part.n | 1 | Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets , he says . Borden even tested a milk with 4 % butterfat in the South , but decided the market was too small . Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and %% parts %% of New Jersey . And it 's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says Greg Ricca , sales director at La Lecheria . Because of Leche Fresca 's success , he says , the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes .
part.n | 1 | `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains . That 's because the male %% part %% , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants .
part.n | 2 | The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser . Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year . The company attributed the decrease in %% part %% to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts . U.K. sales for last year 's quarter were about $ 3 million .
part.n | 1 | Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff , president of its CBS Records unit , said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement . Wayne Smith , an attorney at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony , said the Sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time . '' Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't %% part %% of the negotiations between Sony and the duo . Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up . But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio .
part.n | 1 | %% Part %% of a Series } Tom Panelli had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ 300 rowing machine he bought three years ago . `` I ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he says , making it too painful to row .
part.n | 1 | The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December . The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers . The sale , which had been expected , is %% part %% of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February . Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit . That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .
part.n | 1 | Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old . Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . Most of the land in that and other %% parts %% of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .
part.n | 1 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important %% parts %% of the system it sets out to preserve . The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated . These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .

part.n | 1 | I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell 's exchange with a Gosbank representative ( `` Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails , '' editorial page , Oct. 5 ) with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research . Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . '' During the latter %% part %% of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles . The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world . The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .
part.n | 1 | Frederick B. Taylor , 48 , also was named a vice chairman and chief investment officer , a new post . He previously held similar responsibilities . Mr. Taylor also was named a director , increasing the board to 22 , but is not %% part %% of the new office of the chairman . James E. Bacon , 58 , executive vice president , who has directed the funds-service group , will retire .
part.n | 1 | Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt . The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40 % rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989 , excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests . Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two %% parts %% and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ( $ 325 million ) . This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG . The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50 % stake , also from Beghin-Say .
part.n | 1 | Indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche . The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other . Ms. Bogart 's cast is %% part %% and parcel of the problem . Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna . Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended .
part.n | 2 | Still , analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term . `` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp . That is in %% part %% because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said . In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income . Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said .
part.n | 1 | Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . `` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia . A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been %% part %% of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe . Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law . British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles .
part.n | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As %% part %% of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .

Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars , including George Michael and Whitney Houston , to appear in ads for the diet drink .
part.n | 2 | Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their %% part %% , are satisfied with the police response they receive . Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses . But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
part.n | 1 | And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . `` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs { in the U.S. . } is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production . But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing %% part %% of their allure . `` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago . `` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. Purnick , the New York furrier .

Alusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. , a Zurich , Switzerland , producer of aluminum , chemicals and packaging products .
part.n | 1 | Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $ 75 million stock-for-debt exchange . The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal . As %% part %% of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face value of debt . However , that figure could be revised , Financial Corp. said . Currently , the company has about six million common shares outstanding .
part.n | 1 | The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof . The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza . As %% part %% of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash . Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations . He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million .
part.n | 1 | Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between $ 130 million and $ 134 million . The move , subject to a definitive agreement , is %% part %% of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business . Just last month , a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for $ 168 million , a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year . First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about $ 550 million in loans outstanding .
part.n | 1 | In 1900 , for instance , less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits . That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since . Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small %% part %% of household assets until the last decade , when they skyrocketed . And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms . That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .
part.n | 1 | A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland . Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most %% parts %% of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .

part.n | 1 | The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` Metamorphosis , '' another multiple work . %% Parts %% 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name . When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film . Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium .
people.n | 1 | Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio . The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business . But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and %% people %% familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week . Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions . But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .

And regional offices were `` egregiously overstaffed , '' he claims . One office had 19 %% people %% doing the work of three , `` and half of the employees had company automobiles . '' American Brands declined to comment on Mr. Wathen 's accusations . The acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company , Pinkerton 's , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , California Plant Protection , with $ 250 million in sales , creating the industry 's biggest firm , which took on the Pinkerton 's name .
people.n | 1 | Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. . And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice . `` We have too many %% people %% in our home offices , '' says Yoshio Hatakeyama , the president of the Japan Management Association . `` Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low . '' With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners .
people.n | 1 | It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout . The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found . Fewer %% people %% said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics . Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise . That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
people.n | 1 | Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare . State governments place very low ceilings on how much property %% people %% may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills . Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance . But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
people.n | 1 | The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management . `` The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways , '' Mr. Westendorf concludes . `` First , we have better quality assurance than ever , because the %% people %% building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work . Second , we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product . '' At Grumman 's Aircraft Systems Division , a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract .
people.n | 1 | The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely . This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects . The question , as many %% people %% see it , is how long such uncertainty will last . Maureen Fraser , an economist with W.I. Carr , a subsidiary of France 's Banque Indosuez , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 . It may experience an upswing or two in between .
people.n | 1 | Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral . Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves . The %% people %% of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students . Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians . Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance .
people.n | 1 | In Mr. Luzon 's first year , the bank eliminated 800 jobs . Now it says it 'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years . The bank employs 8,000 %% people %% in Spain and 2,000 abroad . To strengthen its capital base , Banco Exterior this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors . The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches .
people.n | 1 | Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . The number of %% people %% receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % . Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
people.n | 1 | But in 1989 most senators have other ideas . Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama . Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get %% people %% hurt , a charming notion for a great power . Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban . So the administration dropped it .
people.n | 1 | -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect . The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President Roh . But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary %% people %% to buy a home . Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .
people.n | 1 | To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that %% people %% ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year .
people.n | 1 | Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high . Last year , the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area 's casinos , nearly 10 % more than in 1987 . The %% people %% with a stake in Nevada 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade . `` If you build a better mousetrap , it will catch more mice , '' says Fred Benninger , chairman of MGM Grand . Ellen Cokely , a tourist from Alton , Ill. , seems inclined to agree .
people.n | 1 | This is not the case . Some diaries simply are n't worth snooping in . Yet there will be %% people %% who will sob at `` Immediate Family , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption . These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told . Written by Barbara Benedek , co-author of `` The Big Chill , '' `` Immediate Family '' takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children .

'' Given China 's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own %% people %% , Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions . Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations . Sentences have been stiff .

people.n | 1 | No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority , but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts . Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences . `` In the past , %% people %% who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said . `` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
people.n | 2 | The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese %% people %% , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .
people.n | 1 | Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured . %% People %% who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
people.n | 1 | `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 %% people %% in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables .
people.n | 1 | As for junk-holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR . The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar , according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York , which trades distressed securities . %% People %% who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders say that 's not enough .

It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , %% people %% close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .

About 23,000 %% people %% typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours . About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc.

people.n | 2 | In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government . Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort . There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban %% people %% . Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
people.n | 1 | As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for %% people %% aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
people.n | 1 | `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . `` %% People %% honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy .
people.n | 1 | The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . `` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . `` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich %% people %% . '' No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders .

people.n | 1 | `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture %% people %% about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .

people.n | 1 | Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many %% people %% and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .

Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt , say %% people %% close to him , is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls . While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway , are pretty strong . USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. Steinhardt says .

people.n | 4 | United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area . A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors . The United spokesman said none of its %% people %% were injured at the airport ; in fact , as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night , two babies were born . Yesterday , the United ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends . The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
people.n | 2 | Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker : Both spent years overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend , the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens . More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo . Faced with another Mr. Honecker , so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German %% peoples %% will get their reunification , de facto , on West German ground . But if East Germany 's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental . Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall .

people.n | 1 | The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of %% people %% between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % .

The amendment is aimed at skirting a Supreme Court ruling that threw out the conviction of a Texas flag-burner on grounds that his freedom of speech was violated . Federal researchers said lung-cancer mortality rates for %% people %% under 45 years of age have begun to decline , particularly for white males . The National Cancer Institute also projected that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate . Bush met with South Korean President Roh , who indicated that Seoul plans to further ease trade rules to ensure that its economy becomes as open as the other industrialized nations by the mid-1990s .
plant.n | 2 | Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . The researchers said they have isolated a %% plant %% gene that prevents the production of pollen . The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself . Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed .
plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .

The government also urged whites to refrain from panic over growing black protests , such as the massive anti-apartheid rally Sunday on the outskirts of Soweto . Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid %% plants %% for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait .

But Goodyear said total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2 % . Total tire segment sales were up only about 1 % to $ 2.2 billion , and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire %% plants %% because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers . In the latest quarter , Goodyear 's tax rate was 51 % compared with 41 % a year earlier . As a result , total tax outlays were $ 73.5 million , compared with $ 44.1 million the year earlier .
plant.n | 1 | Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say . In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several %% plants %% and reducing labor costs . But the short-term outlook is so-so . It is n't surprising that Messrs. Roderick and Corry view steel so differently .
plant.n | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will build a $ 24 million power %% plant %% to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
plant.n | 1 | Detrex Corp. said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio %% plant %% reduced its third-quarter net income by $ 1.9 million . Detrex , which has annual sales of about $ 100 million , declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter . The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year .
plant.n | 1 | The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants . So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old %% plants %% . The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology . The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles .
plant.n | 1 | In the quarterly report , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer , said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue . Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 . Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing %% plant %% in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs . `` With the Edison plant coming on line next summer , the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future , '' said Peter Appert , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell . `` But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons . ''
plant.n | 1 | The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community . Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ( $ 157.8 million ) in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs . In addition , the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their %% plants %% . Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles . By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
plant.n | 1 | Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected . General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October . GM said the assembly %% plant %% , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
plant.n | 1 | It is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter . Typical , perhaps , was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. , the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont , about 35 miles south of Oakland . Ten of the %% plant %% 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized . Metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says . The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
plant.n | 1 | Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed . Trading on little specific information , market players overnight in Tokyo began bidding up oil prices . The rally spread into European markets , where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the San Francisco area 's large oil refining %% plants %% . By yesterday morning , much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone . West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets .
plant.n | 1 | The commission , which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition . The French chemical giant would hold an 80 % share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin . The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger , Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates %% plant %% Monsanto operates in Wales , removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction .

It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year . The company plans to expand %% plant %% capacity 50 % by 1991 . By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 . Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit .
point.n | 14 | Takamori Matsuda , an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities , said fading expectation for lower interest rates made investors step back from real-estate shares , which advanced last week . Some traders said institutions were waiting to see the U.S. jobless rate to be issued Friday . The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which fell 15.82 %% points %% Friday , was down 5.16 points , or 0.19 % , at 2676.60 . The Second Section index , which fell 36.87 points Friday , was down 21.44 points , or 0.59 % , to close at 3636.06 .

Japanese government bonds showed little change . Japan 's benchmark No. 111 issue due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.90 , down 0.02 %% point %% , to yield 5.435 % . British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by John Major , the new Chancellor of the Exchequer .

point.n | 14 | Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher . The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6.76 points to 2603.48 in light trading after losing more than 92 %% points %% last week . Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy . Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies , the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered British pound , which gained slightly against the dollar .

point.n | 5 | By accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit . As in the U.S. , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever . At this %% point %% , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS .
point.n | 14 | In other markets : -- The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rallied Friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to Nestle Foods Corp. for $ 370 million . The sale price , which was above Wall Street expectations , sent many RJR securities up by one %% point %% . `` It shows that there are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today 's market , '' said Robert Long , managing director and head of the high-yield research department at First Boston Corp . Many of the RJR securities , which had been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session , bounced back after the company 's announcement that it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods , a unit of the Swiss-based food concern .

The bank is a subsidiary of Baltimore-based MNC Financial Inc . The securities were priced to float monthly at 20 basis %% points %% above the 30-day commercial paper rate . The issue , formally titled MNB Home Equity Loan Asset Backed Certificates , Series 1989 , will represent interest in a trust fund of home equity revolving credit line loans originated by the retail finance division of Maryland National Bank and secured primarily by second deeds of trust or second mortgages on single to four-family residential properties . The securities are rated triple-A by Moody 's and Duff & Phelps Inc .
point.n | 14 | But Mr. Greenspan , who has repeatedly said the Fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . '' He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage %% point %% a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter . He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement . Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
point.n | 14 | Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading . Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 %% points %% it did . With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said .
point.n | 14 | Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months . Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year . The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage %% point %% in the latest week to 7.85 % . Long-term CDs declined just a fraction . The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98 % .
point.n | 14 | By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down . When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday . Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 %% points %% on the day . Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar . They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed .
point.n | 14 | Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage %% points %% statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .

The industrial average closed down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 . Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150 a share , triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 %% points %% in the final hour of trading . UAL stock closed at $ 170 a share , down $ 8.375 . Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding .

When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage %% point %% more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . On Friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
point.n | 14 | Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80 . New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares . The industrials were up about 60 %% points %% in the afternoon , but cautious investors took profits before the close . Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally . The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
point.n | 14 | `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .

Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way . First National Bank of Boston , for example , is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage %% point %% on six-month and 12-month CDs . Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week . New York 's Citibank , for instance , increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8 % from 7.9 % .

The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega .

policy.n | 1 | It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems ( `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone %% Policy %% ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 ) . To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted .

Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch . But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen %% policy %% , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing . In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .
policy.n | 1 | To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary %% policy %% . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
policy.n | 1 | As far as the pound goes , some traders say a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week . While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition . Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a %% policy %% squabble with other cabinet members . He was succeeded by John Major , who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation . But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency analysts contend .
policy.n | 1 | Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn . Moreover , state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say . The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government %% policy %% . In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard .

policy.n | 1 | The dollar is still highly volatile . The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic %% policies %% . Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation .

He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define %% policies %% and strategies of the group .

For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses .
policy.n | 1 | But some legislators think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution . THE IRS WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges . %% Policy %% statement P-5-39 sets out terms . As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges . If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
policy.n | 1 | What are the facts on this type of lending ? The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching %% policy %% reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's .
policy.n | 2 | ( Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . ) Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say . Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard %% policies %% as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage . Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
policy.n | 1 | He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of %% policies %% to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
policy.n | 2 | Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older . So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : %% policies %% structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
policy.n | 1 | Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions . At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel %% policies %% . The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ''
policy.n | 1 | This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national %% policy %% making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff . An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) .
policy.n | 1 | The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience . There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years : 1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary %% policy %% could yield a net improvement in employment and output . 2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it . Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
policy.n | 1 | But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . President Bush told reporters : `` Whether that { the leadership change } reflects a change in East-West relations , I do n't think so . Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the %% policies %% of Honecker . '' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
policy.n | 1 | Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget . The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary %% policy %% . Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . '' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
policy.n | 2 | Paramedics were called . A week later , the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . `` It was a powerful point in my career , '' says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis , who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability %% policy %% for his business . `` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage . The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her .
position.n | 2 | After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats . Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and %% positions %% with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year . The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus . Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance .
position.n | 5 | Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional %% position %% . And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
position.n | 5 | Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . '' The move , which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 42.5 million ) in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. Maier said . All 700 Toronto-based employees will be offered %% positions %% in Calgary , the company said . The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added . Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .
position.n | 4 | `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said . But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session . That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial %% positions %% of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
position.n | 4 | But a few funds have taken other defensive steps . Some have raised their cash positions to record levels . High cash %% positions %% help buffer a fund when the market falls . Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year , says John Frabotta , portfolio co-manager . He says the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .
position.n | 2 | `` In all honesty if you ask me , ` Is this man a true believer ? ' I do n't know , '' says John Fowler , head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc . Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's %% position %% on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention . He 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
position.n | 5 | He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit . Mr. Roy could n't be reached . Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo , a new %% position %% . Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo 's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit . Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo 's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold , after a which a new chief executive will be named .
position.n | 4 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short %% position %% change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 ( see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 ) .
position.n | 4 | They might even step up sales in a falling market , he said , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries . Technically , Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level . When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their %% positions %% . Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders .
position.n | 3 | General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong %% positions %% in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
position.n | 4 | Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated . By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today . `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI %% positions %% , Mr. Selkin said . Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . Philip Morris added 1 1\/8 to 44 1\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3\/8 to 70 3\/8 , Merck gained 1 3\/8 to 77 3\/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7\/8 to 43 3\/8 on 2.5 million shares .
position.n | 3 | Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach , Calif. , thrift . Mercury , which has assets of more than $ 2 billion and 24 branches in California , said the action to improve its regulatory capital %% position %% is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation . Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco . Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ 4.875 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
position.n | 2 | Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 . You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls . My %% position %% is one founded on both the facts and the law . Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling ( and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative ) . The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .
position.n | 6 | Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership %% position %% in the coffee business . But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers . `` Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .
position.n | 4 | An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday , but profit-taking on short %% positions %% helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts . While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows . Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen .
position.n | 5 | SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc . Thomas E. Meador , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co. , a Skokie , Ill. , subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm .

In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management .

Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy . `` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample %% power %% to block undesirable deals .
power.n | 1 | If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal %% power %% , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika . Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform . But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
power.n | 3 | Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear %% power %% plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
power.n | 1 | `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' In addition to giving a president %% powers %% to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
power.n | 1 | The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992 , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures . Some forms of private property would be sanctioned . Such moves would greatly reduce the %% power %% of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform . -- FINANCES . Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit .
power.n | 3 | The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides %% power %% to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .

Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear %% power %% plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .
power.n | 3 | More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . In contrast , dashboard computers , %% power %% seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days . GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option .
power.n | 3 | But Conner is n't standing still . Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
power.n | 1 | When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping %% power %% to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors . Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
power.n | 3 | The transactions are unrelated . The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V . Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for %% power %% generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill . That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp . Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
power.n | 3 | When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air . Michael L. Bandler , vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . The battery packs have enough %% power %% for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network , only four went down . One of those was in Hollister , Calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter .
power.n | 1 | Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation . The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the %% power %% to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low .
power.n | 1 | It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought . Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts . Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial %% power %% to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers . That 's the conventional theory anyway . In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
power.n | 1 | It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain %% power %% . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
prepare.v | 2 | Video Telecom Corp. , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television . The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines . And it is %% preparing %% to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network . While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper . An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .

QUOTABLE : In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .

No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to %% prepare %% tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .

They 're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase . `` We 've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores , '' says Kim Renk , a Swank vice %% president %% . But there are limits . Ms. Renk says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs .

president.n | 1 | At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects . Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities . `` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said Rod Young , vice %% president %% of Resource Information Systems Inc. , a Bedford , Mass. , economic-forecasting firm . `` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . '' One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion .
president.n | 1 | Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is . Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts . Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers . Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year . Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
president.n | 3 | The dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold . Capital flight is reported to be strong . The big question is whether the new %% president %% will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills . President Jose Sarney , who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation . The unpopular Mr. Sarney , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule , is n't seeking re-election .
president.n | 1 | `` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . '' BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . William O. McCoy , %% president %% of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter . Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable . For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
president.n | 1 | The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better . Y&R 's Klein Steps Down Arthur Klein , %% president %% of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 . In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense . `` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R , '' Mr. Kroll wrote .
president.n | 1 | Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , %% president %% of Bear Stearns Cos . Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility .
president.n | 1 | The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year . Revenue was C$ 291.6 million , up from C$ 252 million in 1988 . Martin Fabi , Innopac 's %% president %% and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move . `` I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , '' he said . Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .
president.n | 1 | This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by Milton B. Hollander , whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford , Conn. acquired most of its 49.4 % stake in Newport in August .

Davis , Norman Gray , John Virtue , corporate secretary , and Barrett B. Weekes , chairman , %% president %% and chief executive officer . Newport officials did n't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier , Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board .
president.n | 3 | More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution . They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . '' This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the %% president %% can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . '' There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved .
president.n | 1 | But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice %% president %% of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco . `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive . Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
president.n | 1 | He made a special trip to examine U.S. environmental trends because they are often followed in Europe . ENI needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $ 1.3 billion on upgrading its refineries , he says . Oil companies world-wide will have `` to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required , '' says John H. Lichtblau , the %% president %% of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service stations pump fuel into cars . In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves .

Now , in the '90s , we 're headed toward a total resort environment . ''
president.n | 1 | One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's %% president %% . There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor ( and now the governor of Texas ! ) and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees . `` You stay out of it , '' author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying .
president.n | 3 | ( During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . ) TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving . That Labor Day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as %% president %% , Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act . Pension reform was its main thrust . Labor and business leaders , quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .
president.n | 3 | And the vacillation did n't end there . Just a month ago , Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life . Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the %% president %% said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest . But only four days after that , Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat . `` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
president.n | 1 | The remaining four trustees on the Claimants Trust have 60 days to nominate a successor to Mr. Saltzburg . Judge Merhige will make the appointment . CHICAGO LAW FIRM recruits American Express Co. vice %% president %% : Coffield Ungaretti Harris & Slavin brought in Howard A.

president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 3 | The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote . By comparison , Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement . Only 42 GOP members opposed the %% president %% 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year . At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte ( R. , Mass. ) , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position . `` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said Rep. Henry Hyde ( R. , Ill. ) , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement .
president.n | 1 | Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year . Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly . Erich Krampe , %% president %% of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes . Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share . Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .

Cray said its order backlog at Sept. 30 was $ 315 million , down $ 25 million from June 30 . Marcello Gumucio , %% president %% , said the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing orders . '' As for the current period , Mr. Gumucio said , `` We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when Cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share . He added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . ''

president.n | 1 | Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says .

president.n | 3 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the %% president %% complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
president.n | 1 | The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico .

Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million . BanPonce reacted cooly at first , but appeared to be won over , analysts said , by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
president.n | 1 | That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice %% president %% of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings .

'' Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . J.

president.n | 1 | Because of the size of the California market , few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath . But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state . `` What you 're going to get is ` We do n't want to put all of our eggs in one basket ' theory , '' said James H. Renzas , %% president %% of Location Management Services Inc. , a Palo Alto , Calif. , relocation concern . Mr. Renzas , among others , said the quake will prod companies in certain industries , like semiconductors , computers and aerospace , to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California . Because of the quake threat , `` some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere , '' he said .
president.n | 1 | `` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . '' Campbell Soup Co. , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands . `` The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 , '' says Tony Adams , the company 's vice %% president %% for marketing research . `` The best odds are with your core franchise . Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''

produce.v | 1 | Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , %% producing %% a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
produce.v | 2 | Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' %% produced %% by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
produce.v | 1 | Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market ( Figure 6 ) , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has %% produced %% an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .
produce.v | 1 | In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can %% produce %% previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
produce.v | 1 | The Leopard 's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it %% produced %% good results ? ? In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked . The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .
promise.v | 1 | CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience %% promised %% to advertisers . CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .
promise.v | 2 | When we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which %% promised %% investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .

Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Wo n't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil 's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia . I %% promised %% to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice . Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie 's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda 's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles .

He had preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he %% proposed %% to do here . He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor . But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose .
prove.v | 2 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family %% proved %% profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
prove.v | 1 | He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably . He treats it with a mythological , universal application . As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be %% proven %% by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families . Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil . Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
prove.v | 2 | He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing %% proved %% to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men 's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
purchase.v | 1 | The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York . Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale . The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD %% purchased %% in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
purchase.v | 1 | One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to %% purchase %% the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
raise.v | 1 | Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years . The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead . A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth 's polar ice caps , %% raising %% the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas . `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
raise.v | 1 | But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations . The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further %% raises %% the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months .
raise.v | 1 | Northeast Utilities %% raised %% its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value claimed by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid .
raise.v | 1 | The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) . The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats . They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart %% raises %% and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal . They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow . The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
raise.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it %% raised %% its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
raise.v | 1 | `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by %% raising %% or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .

raise.v | 2 | Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he %% raised %% his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as usual , loved it .

I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to %% raise %% the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .

Coke has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country . That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption %% rate %% -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. .

rate.n | 1 | Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point . Several other European central banks , notably in Britain , followed the West German Bundesbank 's lead by raising their own key rates . And a week later , Japan raised its official discount %% rate %% by a half point to 3.75 % . The Japanese discount rate is the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks . After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3\/4 % .

'' Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year . That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the %% rate %% down sharply in August and September . Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .

'' The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds . It said long-term interest %% rates %% , then above 9 % , could drop to 7 % by the end of 1989 , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy . The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40 % to 45 % and later to 55 % . But this September -- just when many market economists , including some at Merrill Lynch , believed that Mr. Straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
rate.n | 1 | We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience .

Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating %% rates %% , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .

As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them . `` Insurance companies will offer a good %% rate %% if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide . `` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % .

Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk . Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic , the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R. 's Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany 's new maximum leader .
rate.n | 2 | The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1 % %% rate %% of the two previous months , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said . The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier , reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries . The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year ; since February of this year , unemployment has been steady at around 6.2 % of the labor force .
rate.n | 1 | So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's . From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time . Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest %% rates %% , though up a bit recently , are still low . And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment . But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding .
rate.n | 1 | On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % . Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors . `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , %% rates %% can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . '' Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
rate.n | 1 | New England Electric System , Westborough , Mass. , has proposed buying the company for $ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years . The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan . The other bidder is United Illuminating Co. , New Haven , Conn. , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % %% rate %% increases .
rate.n | 1 | So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture %% rate %% of direct tax is so unfair . If you are a salaried man , Amen ! 100 % captured . If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % .
rate.n | 1 | `` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says . David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations . Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of %% rate %% pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains . In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations . The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .
rate.n | 1 | The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink . `` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in %% rates %% , '' Mr. Ely said . For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion . For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion .
rate.n | 2 | We ca n't afford to wait . '' But does it have to be so soon ? Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating %% rate %% , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. . Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
rate.n | 1 | Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . Corporate Issues Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest %% rates %% . Three of the largest offerings , by Exxon Capital Corp. , Xerox Corp. and Citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc . Exxon Capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % .
rate.n | 1 | A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year . Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . Belo said it increased its effective tax %% rate %% to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 . The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year .

rate.n | 1 | The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London . In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ( $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange %% rates %% ) , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
rate.n | 2 | In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback . `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company . Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth %% rate %% of 26 % in the first half . In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier . The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
rate.n | 2 | The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . But the %% rate %% of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .

rate.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest %% rates %% as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
rate.n | 1 | At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' I call her agent , David Dominici . Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest %% rates %% stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that .
rate.n | 1 | Information systems posted a loss of $ 8 million , compared with a loss of $ 9 million a year earlier . Customer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % . A 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest %% rates %% . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Contel closed at $ 33.75 a share , down .50 cents .
rate.n | 1 | Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight %% rates %% . `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
rate.n | 1 | And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise %% rates %% on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April .
rate.n | 1 | But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks . If so , that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so . That , in turn , is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark %% rate %% on many corporate and consumer loans , by half a percentage point , to 10 % . `` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said George R. Mateyo , president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. , Cleveland . But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates . ''
rate.n | 1 | As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . That %% rate %% would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
rate.n | 1 | That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value ( plus , in some cases , a sweetener ) . When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest %% rates %% are puny . If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University .
rate.n | 1 | Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . '' Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel 's offers of %% rate %% cuts . `` Everyone left , '' said Peter Lang , reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel . The Westin St. Francis hotel , which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire , currently is less than 50 % occupied .
rate.n | 1 | Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March . In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September . `` %% Rates %% have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. Regalia said . `` We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . '' Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .

The base %% rate %% on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks . FEDERAL FUNDS : 8 3\/4 % high , 8 5\/8 % low , 8 11\/16 % near closing bid , 8 11\/16 % offered . Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $ 1 million or more .
rate.n | 2 | Eugene Sit , president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis , says , `` When we bought it , we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds ( the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for Uncle Sam 's check ) . But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth , Mr. Sit says . He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual %% rate %% ( down from about 14 % the past five years ) and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , H&R Block does n't even come close .

rate.n | 1 | No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House . That plan would provide a 30 % exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending Dec. 31 , 1991 . After then , the House measure would boost the tax %% rate %% to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation . Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent . Separately , Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit .
rate.n | 2 | Hence the LBO craze . But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way . The profit %% rate %% is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 . Result : a landscape littered with lemons , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America . The mounting risks did not go unobserved , even in the mid-1980s .
rate.n | 2 | -- Among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge . Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years , the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 . The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty %% rate %% would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % -- under the alternative calculation . Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years . A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded , `` It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes . ''

rate.n | 1 | Then , if the stocks fell sharply , he planned to begin buying them aggressively , on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month 's Hurricane Hugo . As well , reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits . Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher %% rates %% in the industry , which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition . But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts . `` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said .
rate.n | 1 | We think revenue will continue to grow and that we can control costs and thus improve profitability . '' Southwestern Bell Corp . Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7 % , mainly the result of four extraordinary items : a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year ; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third ; a %% rate %% refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues . Revenue slipped 1.2 % to $ 2.21 billion from $ 2.23 billion . The earnings drop had been expected .
rate.n | 1 | Meanwhile , the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $ 90,000 fell to 7.93 % in the latest week , according to Banxquote , from 8.10 % the week before . Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding . CDs sold by major brokerage houses , which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest %% rate %% trends , also posted larger drops in yields . A six-month , broker-sold CD , for example , was yielding an average 8.09 % in the latest week , a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before . In late April , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks .
rate.n | 1 | But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest %% rate %% to decline about one-quarter percentage point . The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks .
rate.n | 2 | `` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities .

'' But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality %% rates %% are rising in developing countries . `` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education .

rate.n | 1 | James G. Zafris , president of Danvers Savings Bank , Danvers , Mass. , says the market turmoil `` is an absolute non-event for small business .

Peter Drake , biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently .

Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that %% receive %% its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .

John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .

Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month .

regard.v | 2 | Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and %% regarded %% us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .
remember.v | 1 | They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition . But they need not be to do their jobs well . Yes , we all can %% remember %% one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days . But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious . In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
remember.v | 1 | At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not %% remember %% , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now . We had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .
remember.v | 1 | He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` %% Remember %% the Starbird ? ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down . `` The Starbird , '' Abel said . There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished .
remember.v | 1 | To fuck up the program . You guys remember that . %% Remember %% that He heard himself haranguing them . He saw himself before them delivering the speech . He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention .
remember.v | 1 | `` When you got ta go , you got ta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said . Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he %% remembered %% of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley . `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said . `` Can I make you one '' ? ?
remember.v | 1 | Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden . Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards . She closed her eyes , %% remembering %% the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
remember.v | 1 | It was true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala . The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . He found himself trying to %% remember %% something , but he could n't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .
remember.v | 1 | But he was always persuaded out . He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never %% remember %% whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .
remove.v | 1 | Staar Surgical Co. 's board said that it has %% removed %% Thomas R. Waggoner as president and chief executive officer and that John R. Wolf , formerly executive vice president , sales and marketing , has been named president and chief executive officer . Mr. Waggoner has been involved in a dispute with the board since August , when he ousted all the directors . Later they said they fired him , and two directors attempted to place the company under bankruptcy-law protection .
remove.v | 1 | Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , %% remove %% the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ? That is questionable , to say the least . Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .
remove.v | 1 | There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain . `` Have him come in '' . Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously %% removed %% from their customary places . `` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely . An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
replace.v | 1 | It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots . Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to %% replace %% the Red Delicious , '' he says . The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon . New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
replace.v | 1 | The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs . So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change . What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to %% replace %% them . Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago . A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
replace.v | 1 | It was so dark that he did n't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had %% replaced %% his biwa with a friend . An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
report.v | 1 | Cie . Generale des Eaux %% reported %% that net profit climbed 30 % in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25 % for the full year . The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs ( US$ 119.2 million ) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988 . Revenue climbed 13 % to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion .
report.v | 1 | Since then , deliveries have slumped . GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid-October to 69,980 , while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 . GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers %% reported %% mixed results . All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made cars , including those built at Japanese-managed plants , falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier . The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
report.v | 1 | `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . '' AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government %% reports %% about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing .
report.v | 1 | Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates . Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was %% reported %% earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say . `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer .
report.v | 1 | Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back . It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who %% report %% low income and large expenses from a part-time business . The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields . For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .
report.v | 1 | The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it %% reports %% operating results this week . Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
report.v | 1 | Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces . Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn . Rep. Bill McCollum ( R. , Fla. ) %% reports %% that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics . In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public .
report.v | 2 | Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . It was %% reported %% to Welch 's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . Welch wanted to know why . No one knew .
rush.v | 1 | They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country . `` The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps . Nothing appalling or horrible %% rushed %% upon these men . Only there happened -- nothing . There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .
say.v | 1 | Banca Nazionale del Lavoro %% said %% its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ( $ 872 million ) , marking the bank 's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch . BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $ 3 billion without the Rome-based management 's approval . State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties .
say.v | 1 | Earlier this year , Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $ 600 million a year . Friday 's auction will be limited to $ 150 million disbursed by the Central Bank to potential investors . The office of foreign investment has authorized some $ 1.78 billion worth of investment proposals , %% said %% Edwin Perozo , superintendent of foreign investment . Most of the proposals are in tourism , basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects , he said . Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers .
say.v | 1 | The law , which Bush allowed to take effect without his signature , went into force Friday . Chinese officials said armed police would replace soldiers in Tiananmen Square as part of a scaling down of Beijing 's five-month-old state of emergency . Separately , the U.S. Embassy has filed three protests in as many days with China 's government , alleging harassment of diplomats and their families , an embassy source %% said %% . Authorities in Algeria said the toll from two earthquakes Sunday had reached at least 30 dead and about 250 injured . The heaviest damage was reported in Tipasa , about 40 miles west of Algiers .
say.v | 1 | The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes . It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far . In any case , %% says %% Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer .
say.v | 1 | `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen . These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers %% said %% , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change . Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said . Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
say.v | 1 | It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras . On Oct. 20 , the town 's mayor , Robert Reid , made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers . `` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' %% says %% Joe Sukle , the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown . `` They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards . They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama . ''
say.v | 1 | As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs . The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts %% say %% . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
say.v | 1 | He points to a letter on his desk , his second in a week from President Bush , saying that they `` do n't disagree . '' More broadly , Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power . `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he %% says %% . Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation .
say.v | 1 | It says 40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 's . Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable . Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official %% says %% . Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back . Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
say.v | 1 | Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' %% says %% one investment banker who follows the retail industry . `` Looking only at a narrow American strategy is n't where it 's at . '' Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , analysts say .
say.v | 1 | Chinese officials are trying to use the Canton Trade Fair to lure back overseas traders after the bloody crackdown on dissent . But attendance is down from previous years . What 's more , a Hong Kong textile trader %% says %% , some Chinese exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown by dragging their feet on soliciting new business . `` They are angry about the government ... so they hold back the goods , '' he said . This autumn 's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31 .
say.v | 1 | He called the battle `` uphill . '' Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic . `` There will be no capital-gains bill this year , '' %% said %% Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) . `` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal . The IRA portion ( of the Packwood-Roth plan ) is irresponsible . ''
say.v | 1 | Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting , a ministry spokesman said . They also wanted to prevent a NATO training base being built in the region , he said . The action , in the Canadian Federal Court , will be against Canada , the Netherlands , West Germany , Britain and the U.S. , the ministry spokesman %% said %% . Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation , an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said . Japan has been testing imported food from Europe since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union , the spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | If the law leaves loopholes , use them . If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one %% said %% I should n't '' and brazen it out . As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . )
say.v | 1 | `` My husband was instantly impoverished by the very act of marrying me , '' she says . Another former EPA official , Rita Lavelle , is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges . `` There 's nothing she could do to bring herself back to where she was , '' %% says %% her lawyer , James Bierbower . `` You could say she survived , but it was n't easy on her . '' No book contracts have been dangled before Deborah Gore Dean , the reigning queen of the HUD scandal .
say.v | 1 | Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother . In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan . In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush %% said %% he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote . As Mr. Reagan 's running mate , though , Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion . He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life .
say.v | 1 | International Technology Corp. and Davy McKee Corp. , a unit of London 's Davy Corp. , said they were awarded a $ 55 million contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the closure of the Helen Kramer Landfill Superfund site in Mantua Township , N.J . International Technology , an environmental management concern , %% said %% the contract includes construction of slurry walls , gas collection systems , a multilayer cap and water treatment plant .
say.v | 1 | The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed . Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share . Yesterday , Delmed %% said %% it `` continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA . '' It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination `` would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced . '' While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .
say.v | 1 | In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff , the defense accused one of the government 's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff . Mr. Laff 's attorney , John Lang , filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness , Henry Lorin , told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed . The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang %% said %% was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff . In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it . In March , Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy , mail and securities fraud , and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
say.v | 1 | Earlier this month , the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act . But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work . `` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' %% said %% press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill . Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there .
say.v | 1 | `` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . '' The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill .

say.v | 1 | Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender . In the mid-1980s , after ABC had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 Winter Games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices . `` I love Pilson , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' %% says %% Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president . `` And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . '' Rivals carp at `` the principle of Pilson , '' as NBC 's Arthur Watson once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . ''

But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17 % less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month . Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the GM-Toyota price , %% says %% Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc . Other admen , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges . The Winter Games outlook also is mixed .
say.v | 1 | The American depositary receipts of Jaguar jumped 3\/8 to 11 5\/8 on turnover of 1.9 million .

The Montvale , N.J. , unit said the new operating structure `` creates a more focused and responsive organization geared to effectively managing the size and scope of the unit 's current business . '' The consumer brands unit was absorbed by the photographic , pharmaceutical and chemical concern last year when it acquired Sterling Drug Inc .
say.v | 1 | With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said .

But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black . '' `` It 's hard to see how an investment by the largest { cable operator } in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive , when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest '' cable operator , Mr. Kern said .
say.v | 1 | `` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . '' Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC %% said %% it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .
say.v | 1 | Cutting against the downward trend was Continental , which jumped 4 marks to 346 marks ( $ 187 ) in heavy trading on rumors that the tire maker is about to be taken over . It jumped 7.5 Monday . Traders %% said %% the market was exceptionally thin , as small investors remain on the sidelines . Market participants say investors are not only licking their wounds following the turbulence last week , but they have also been made nervous by two events in West Germany . On Sunday , the governing Christian Democratic Union suffered a series of setbacks , the extent of which became fully known only late Monday , in municipal elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg .
say.v | 1 | BUELL INDUSTRIES Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to five cents a share , payable Nov. 17 to stock of record Nov. 3 . The company 's quarterly dividend had been 10 cents a share since April 30 , 1988 . Buell recently %% said %% it would incur an aftertax charge of about $ 3.6 million in its fourth quarter ending Tuesday , in connection with the sale and discontinuance of several lines at a plant . The Waterbury , Conn. , maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding .
say.v | 1 | Murata Mfg. Co. %% said %% it is establishing a subsidiary in Britain to produce electric parts , including ceramic condensers . The Tokyo maker of ceramic capacitors said it purchased a plant in Plymouth . The company did n't disclose a purchase price or capitalization figures .
say.v | 1 | There is hope of change . Last week , Sen. Malcolm Wallop ( R. , Wyo . ) held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses . `` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses , '' %% says %% Marian Jacob , a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop . Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act , which many feel benefited small enterprises . Thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it .
say.v | 1 | Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews . To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense . `` You need one person to just take care of sales tax , '' %% says %% Jennie Tong , executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc. , New York .
say.v | 1 | Judge Robert ( `` Maximum Bob '' ) Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday , while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days , plus 120 hours of work with homeless women . Miss Gabor recanted her earlier-expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians . Mr. Bakker %% said %% he was guilty of sin but not fraud . We can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be America 's Celebrity Convict .
say.v | 1 | Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year . Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified . One Mobil executive %% said %% that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved . Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .
say.v | 1 | He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec , two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland 's poorest places . Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village , on a visit to the Communist administrator , the `` naczelnik .

He is our most dangerous enemy .
say.v | 1 | But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , %% said %% she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners . Mr. Yeutter , seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 .
say.v | 1 | Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , %% says %% Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples . Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree .
say.v | 1 | `` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says Jack Rodman , managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm . But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy . The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , %% says %% Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner . And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time . Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
say.v | 1 | The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says . If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly . Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS %% says %% ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .

say.v | 1 | Italy 's unemployment rate rose to 12 % of the labor force in July from 11.9 % in April , and was up from 11.7 % a year earlier , according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute . Istat %% said %% a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April , and from 2,853,000 a year ago . The unemployment rate was by far the highest in the southern , so-called Mezzogiorno region . The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3 % in July from 21.2 % in April and from 20.6 % a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat . Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15 , satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the PLO . A U.S. counterterrorism official %% said %% experts are studying the Israeli list . `` We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15 , 1988 , '' he said , referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads . `` So far , this list does n't change our view .
say.v | 1 | These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . Officials in some of these states %% say %% they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
say.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , %% said %% Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
say.v | 1 | Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen . Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen .

Weyerhaeuser said its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in Chesapeake , Va. , and Hancock , Vt .
say.v | 1 | `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it %% says %% the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
say.v | 1 | One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay . But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . Although one transportation official %% said %% drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
say.v | 1 | The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation . `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' %% says %% Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned . `` The magazine is strong . It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. Lipstein %% said %% . `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added .
say.v | 1 | `` They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together , but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan , '' he said . Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners . `` Five years ago , magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser 's big ad schedule for their magazine , '' %% said %% Mr. Murphy . `` But the marketplace changed . Advertisers now say ` Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . '
say.v | 4 | Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads . The report to Congress %% said %% that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates .
say.v | 1 | MINORITY RECRUITING has yet to meet hopes raised by Bush administration . Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they %% said %% was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring .
say.v | 1 | `` There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who know their responsibilities , '' he says . THE CHECKOFF : At least somebody gains on layoffs . The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms %% says %% the industry 's volume has soared tenfold since 1980 , to $ 350 million a year ... . And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89 , the benefits test fought by most employers . Triad Solutions says software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now have no use .
say.v | 1 | Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir . A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan . But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , %% said %% if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir .
say.v | 1 | The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 1.71 billion during the first eight months of 1989 from $ 807 million a year earlier . Imports continued to outpace Philippine exports , despite gains in shipments abroad , the government National Statistics Office %% said %% . Exports reached $ 5.12 billion , up from $ 4.52 billion a year earlier , while imports rose to $ 6.81 billion from $ 5.33 billion . The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $ 1.09 billion for all of 1988 .
say.v | 1 | The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials %% said %% nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
say.v | 1 | TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains . Donaldson Lufkin would n't comment . Credit analysts %% said %% investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt . Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular . Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday .
say.v | 1 | People who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders %% say %% that 's not enough . They contend that SCI TV 's equity now is worthless . They add that it is n't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think contributed to SCI TV 's current problems .
say.v | 1 | `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . '' She %% said %% copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday . However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year . Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .
say.v | 1 | Japan 's production of cars , trucks and buses in September fell 4.1 % from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association %% said %% . Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2 % fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas , according to the association . The association said domestic demand grew 8.8 % in September .
say.v | 1 | Harsco Corp. said it obtained a $ 33.1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment . Harsco declined to say what country placed the order . The company %% said %% it received an order for 23 of the vehicles , which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged , and an option for 16 more . Delivery is to begin in early 1991 . Harsco produces products for defense , industrial , commercial and construction markets .
say.v | 1 | It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc. , the intimate apparel division , and Playtex Family Products Corp. , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products . Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel . Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , %% says %% Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously . When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says . The company could command a good price in the market .
say.v | 1 | `` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ? That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . '' `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he %% says %% , `` because she taught me how to listen . Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber .
say.v | 1 | Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , %% said %% it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group . Rhone-Poulenc , a chemical and pharmaceutical company , said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $ 900 million . It did n't release terms of the transaction .
say.v | 1 | She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car . Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she %% says %% . Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''
say.v | 1 | Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party . These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . `` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' %% says %% Mr. Revson . `` It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . '' But name-dropping has other benefits , often civic .
say.v | 1 | Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating . `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' %% says %% Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company . In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so . Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe Treasury securities .
say.v | 1 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' %% says %% Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
say.v | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen %% says %% he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez %% says %% he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously .
say.v | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel %% said %% . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
say.v | 1 | A crowd estimated at 100,000 held a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman %% said %% . The space shuttle Atlantis landed at a desert air strip at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , ending a five-day mission that dispatched the Jupiter-bound Galileo space probe . The five astronauts returned to Earth about three hours early because high winds had been predicted at the landing site .
say.v | 1 | Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . Exxon %% said %% in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct . The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
say.v | 1 | Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August . `` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities %% said %% . `` It 's better to wait . '' The Financial Times 100-share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7 .
say.v | 1 | Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time . Environmental lawyers %% say %% virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
say.v | 1 | Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term . Its stock , at 9 5\/8 , trades at about 8 1\/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers . Mr. Bullock %% says %% 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management .
say.v | 1 | So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . While some %% say %% the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp .
say.v | 1 | For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts %% said %% , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . '' A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
say.v | 1 | But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine ( The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client ) . `` He asked me not to resign .

say.v | 1 | He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically %% said %% that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .

But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . Psychologists %% say %% isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves . For instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? ''
say.v | 1 | Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , %% says %% Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .

Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . The surge in production , analysts %% say %% , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
say.v | 1 | The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .

'' Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
say.v | 1 | Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He %% says %% courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
say.v | 1 | Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he %% says %% . Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .

'' Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , %% said %% that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound .
say.v | 1 | Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory %% said %% researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
say.v | 1 | The incident occurred Saturday night . The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting .

say.v | 1 | Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' %% says %% Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . `` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
say.v | 1 | Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They %% said %% the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .

He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 .
see.v | 3 | Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait . Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one . Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be %% seen %% in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala . When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . New York City :
see.v | 2 | Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants %% saw %% these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
see.v | 1 | Residents of this city soon will be %% seeing %% ads urging them to visit `` Cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- Lake View Cemetery . Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times . So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign .
see.v | 3 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to %% see %% defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
see.v | 2 | `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't %% see %% a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
see.v | 1 | So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market . Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative . Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade ( %% see %% accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 ) . Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment .
see.v | 3 | Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post . BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics . Despite %% seeing %% his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation . Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir , for backing down on the elections , and at Shamir 's rival , Peres , for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker 's plan . Meanwhile , some U.S. officials fear PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
set.v | 6 | Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in %% setting %% off the cancer . But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared . Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer .
set.v | 4 | `` It has never been interested in what we think . The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee %% set %% up after the 1987 crash . `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it { program trading } , but they { the exchange } ca n't do it , '' he said . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
set.v | 3 | The state attorney general 's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms , charging them with responsibility for much of a $ 200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer 's office in 1987 . The suit %% sets %% the firms ' liability at more than $ 185 million . The firms are Morgan Stanley & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , County Natwest Government Securities Inc. , Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman , Sachs & Co . The firms have all said that West Virginia 's suit is without merit .
set.v | 5 | In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer . Take Cleveland . It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk %% set %% his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
set.v | 6 | Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami . `` These guys prey on human frailties . '' While the promises of big profits ought to %% set %% off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
set.v | 3 | My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern %% set %% by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .
set.v | 4 | And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to %% set %% up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations . We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .

Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , %% setting %% up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol . Warren eased his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an A[fj] . This he placed within quick reach .

share.n | 2 | Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder . Giovanni Agnelli , a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat 's Agnelli family , owns approximately 75 % of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale , which in turn owns approximately 40 % of Fiat , Italy 's biggest private-sector industrial group . The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary %% shares %% in the limited partnership , which will give her control of 4.67 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co . The Aga Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for 7.45 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital . His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies .
share.n | 2 | At the close , the narrower 30-share index was up 19.7 points to 1721.4 . Volume totaled a modest 334.5 million shares , up from 257.8 million shares Monday . The market also moved at early afternoon on news that Jaguar %% shares %% were being temporarily suspended at 746 pence ( $ 11.80 ) each . Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar , the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor . The golden share dates from Jaguar 's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover .

In late trading , the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ( $ 1.93 ) -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares . In the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar %% shares %% trading as American Depositary Receipts closed at $ 13.625 , up $ 1.75 . Analysts expect Ford will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about 900 pence ( $ 14.25 ) a share . Such a proposal values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.53 billion ) .
share.n | 2 | `` The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17 . `` Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal . '' Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' %% shares %% within about a month after the transaction . But about 25 % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late . The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes .

share.n | 2 | Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the Big Board 's factions . But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading . Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many companies that have %% shares %% listed on the Big Board . Mr. Phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just `` how the world is . If bringing the message is a crime , I 'm guilty of it . ''
share.n | 2 | But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market 's surge , as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session . Georgia-Pacific fell 2 1\/2 to 50 7\/8 , but most paper and forest-products stocks firmed as market players speculated about other potential industry takeover targets . Within the paper sector , Mead climbed 2 3\/8 to 38 3\/4 on 1.3 million %% shares %% , Union Camp rose 2 3\/4 to 37 3\/4 , Federal Paper Board added 1 3\/4 to 23 7\/8 , Bowater gained 1 1\/2 to 27 1\/2 , Stone Container rose 1 to 26 1\/8 and Temple-Inland jumped 3 3\/4 to 62 1\/4 .

share.n | 2 | But Asher B. Edelman , who controls about 16 % of the San Antonio , Texas , computer-servicing company , insisted that the announcement did n't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp . Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint . Intelogic holds 27.5 % of Datapoint 's common %% shares %% outstanding . Mr. Edelman said the decision `` has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman . '' Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of Datapoint .
share.n | 2 | Coast Savings Financial Inc. reported a third-quarter loss , citing a previously announced capital restructuring program .

Chairman Carl L. Bixby said the decline occurred although revenue rose 30 % to more than $ 8.3 million from $ 6.4 million a year earlier . The company , which makes computer parts said fiscal 1989 earnings were `` down slightly '' from $ 3.2 million , or 74 cents a share , in fiscal l988 .
share.n | 2 | Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice president .

For the third quarter , net rose to $ 242 million , or $ 1.05 a share , from $ 144 million , or 63 cents a %% share %% . Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .
share.n | 2 | Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed . But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined . Each company 's %% share %% of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension .

In national over-the-counter trading , LIN %% shares %% soared $ 4.625 to closed at $ 112.625 , while McCaw fell $ 2.50 a share to $ 37.75 . The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company , including the newly acquired Metromedia stake , would give the new entity 55 million potential customers , including about 35 million in the nation 's top 10 markets . Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984 .
share.n | 2 | Securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year . Some had predicted earnings of more than $ 4 a share for this year , up from last year 's fully diluted $ 3.27 a share on earnings of $ 680.6 million . But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a %% share %% fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion .

The GM agreement is expected to retain Jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual 30 % stake for the U.S. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures .

Some analysts have estimated IBM 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall 10 % to $ 3.57 a %% share %% from $ 3.97 a share a year earlier . In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , IBM announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single cartridge .

share.n | 2 | Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization , domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen . Investors expect these shares will be targets of investment trust funds , which often buy small amounts spread across a wide range of issues . On the other hand , high-priced %% shares %% such as Pioneer Electronic and Sony failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds , observers said .

share.n | 2 | HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14 % to $ 23.9 million , or $ 1.10 per fully diluted share , from $ 27.9 million , or $ 1.21 a fully diluted %% share %% , because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property . The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed 's stock , which lost 8.6 % of its value , closing at $ 38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , down $ 3.625 . HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market .
share.n | 2 | In June , the company agreed to settle for $ 18 million several lawsuits related to its sales practices , without admitting or denying the charges .

'' Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy %% shares %% or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs ( about $ 2.60 ) for each transaction , bringing the total fee to 200 francs .

The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks , who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors .
share.n | 2 | Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1\/2 , also up 1\/4 , on volume of 700,000 . Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1\/8 to 49 1\/2 .

Sears said its U.S. stores had a loss of $ 6.9 million , their first deficit for the period in more than five years .
share.n | 2 | That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business . Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits .

Some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments .
share.n | 2 | Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million . The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .

's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
share.n | 2 | The overall London market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating . The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index plummeted 40.4 points to close at 2149.3 . Traders credited Euro Disney 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the %% shares %% are destined to help finance : Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris . The park is slated to open in 1992 . `` The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known , you can say world-wide , name , '' said Vernon Dempsey , head trader of European equities at Kleinwort Benson Ltd. , which is making a market in the issue .

( Storer also took $ 125 million of junior SCI TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets . ) With the other hand , KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10 % of the cash it had taken out , buying SCI TV common and preferred %% shares %% . So , while KKR today has an estimated $ 250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV , including equity and debt , the LBO firm still is $ 1 billion ahead on the SCI TV buy-out after taking cash up front . On Storer as a whole , KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60 % in the three years it owned Storer .
share.n | 2 | That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose . However , a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday . The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240 a %% share %% , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .

Even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't quarrel with the board 's logic .

Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a %% share %% , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year .

share.n | 2 | We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its %% shares %% before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name . Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders .
share.n | 2 | Union Carbide , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined 1\/2 to 24 1\/2 .

share.n | 1 | Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle . `` One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price . James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate %% share %% of high earnings stocks .

He is putting money in Dress Barn , Circuit City Stores , Bruno 's , and Rubbermaid .
share.n | 2 | Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility . Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview . But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a %% share %% , in 1988 . That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate . In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .
share.n | 2 | Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations . Net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a %% share %% , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward . In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward . Revenue slipped 0.7 % to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million .

share.n | 1 | The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters . Still , there was a breakthrough at Geneva . Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage %% share %% of the group 's total output target , or ceiling . But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an Iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers . In the end politics got in the way .
share.n | 2 | Last week , Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name .

share.n | 2 | Under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders . Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company . For example , the group could offer $ 200 a %% share %% in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share .

Valley National said its $ 110 million provision for credit losses and $ 11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the Arizona real estate market .
share.n | 2 | Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now . Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't . In recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his %% shares %% . Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ? The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .

share.n | 2 | They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single %% share %% of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . `` There is n't a boatload { of big investors } out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services .

share.n | 2 | The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company 's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL 's controlling Quek family , brokers in Singapore say . The Queks control the Hong Leong Group , which has widespread interests in manufacturing , property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore . News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday , but brokers said that the market and CDL %% shares %% recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally .

Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire . The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar %% shares %% without permission until Dec. 31 , 1990 . But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely . `` It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar , observed Mr. Barber of James Capel .

Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4 % held by an associate , the stake would have given him control of 55 % of the concern . In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45 % of United Merchants would receive one-half %% share %% of a new preferred stock for each of their shares . A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations , it could n't recommend the plan to the full board .

share.n | 2 | The electronics , automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ 60 million , or 98 cents a share , down from $ 68 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier . Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis , by company tradition . Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a %% share %% for recall of faulty truck steering systems . The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs .

share.n | 2 | In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares . AMR was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 . Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a %% share %% , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 . Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees . However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .
source.n | 3 | Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee backed off a move to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans , according to sources familiar with the committee . In a meeting in New York yesterday , the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for Eastern 's future , the %% sources %% said . The consultants had been working to finish a report this week . That means Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston , can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today , when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee .
source.n | 6 | `` The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate . The result was a more thoughtful , complete and competitive proposal , '' Mr. Anton concludes . The successes achieved at Federal Express , Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized %% source %% of competitive advantage . Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction . They effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time .
source.n | 6 | Now , they 're charging as little $ 3 a day . `` If they 're telling the truth now , then they 've been charging 300 % more than what is reasonable , '' says Steve Gardner , an assistant state attorney general in Texas . A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a %% source %% of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . '' But Hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ 3.95 a day in Texas , while some competitors are charging $ 6.99 . The state attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices .
source.n | 6 | Still , Mr. Mack says he talks to `` 30 members of Congress a week . '' Misery Loves Company Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best %% source %% of solace . Raymond Donovan , the New Jersey construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985 , only to be acquitted of fraud charges , often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear . Each time a new scandal hits , he says , `` it pulls the scabs off your knees . ''
source.n | 4 | This bias is in no way deliberate . The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data . The first of three major %% sources %% of error is the use of labor input estimates ( mainly employment or hours ) instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data . This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor . In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
source.n | 4 | `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a %% source %% of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
source.n | 3 | In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to . One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . But a congressional %% source %% close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S. . Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama . One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
source.n | 3 | The world might want to believe that the Khmer Rouge ca n't still be such bad guys , just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place . But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed . Some of our %% sources %% in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader , Pol Pot , has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border . So it 's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh . True , Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition , at least for this week .
source.n | 1 | Politics and economics conspired . Japan and Europe , far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S. , would n't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies . The U.S. did manage to supply the Dutch with oil by relabeling supplies ; once oil is shipped , no one can tell its %% source %% . But car-happy Americans panicked , and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments . `` Shortage '' and `` crisis '' became buzz words , although neither really applied .
space.n | 1 | This provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients ' portfolios . But the promise of at least $ 15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere . The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the %% space %% station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion . A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits . And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the bill would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe .

The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail %% space %% . They are spread around the country and include locations in California , Florida , Washington and Arizona . Mr. Pilevsky , who heads Philips International Holding Corp. , a New York-based real estate company , owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant .
space.n | 2 | A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December . If Mr. McDonough 's plans get executed , as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from Warsaw 's abundant rubble . A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial %% space %% . Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow . The windows will open .
space.n | 2 | For Carat , meanwhile , the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France . Carat 's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space . By buying the %% space %% in bulk , they obtain discounts as high as 50 % , which they can pass on to customers . They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co. , Fiat S.p . A. , Gillette and Kodak . But now , other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe .

start.v | 3 | Then , in May 1988 , Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network . Mr. Pilson gave him one : He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France ; ABC and NBC would n't bid even $ 200 million . That %% started %% the still-raging bidding wars . The `` Major Events '' strategy , Mr. Pilson says , is designed to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s . It 's also a fast fix for an ailing image .

No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly . But it 's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett did n't manage to boost SCI TV 's operating profit after the buy-out .
start.v | 2 | The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action . President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security . There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should %% start %% passing out exploding cigars . The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed . In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility .
start.v | 2 | C. Olivetti & Co. , claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip , unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday . The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips . Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't %% start %% shipping the computers until early next year . An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said .

The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland 's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi 's current visit to Warsaw . The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered .

I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could %% start %% a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched . There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .

There was only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept . He %% started %% by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper . Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself . At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .

In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , %% Start %% wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' .

state.n | 2 | `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County .

The inquiry soon focused on the judge . Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
state.n | 2 | Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a %% state %% imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years . So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait .
state.n | 2 | The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination . The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of ( New York 's ) unlawful employment practices . '' Justice Rubin , a %% state %% judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number . The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
state.n | 2 | But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined . Each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a %% state %% law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension . ( Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz , and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz )
state.n | 2 | `` How do you prove a negative ? '' Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. Boyd explains . At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular %% states %% have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants . Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence . The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling .

Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a %% state %% run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
state.n | 2 | The result is that instead of the Pentagon 's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30 . The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees ; meanwhile , lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states . House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) helped secure $ 49.7 million for his %% state %% , or more than double the Pentagon 's budget . West Virginia , home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , would receive $ 21.5 million -- four times the military 's request . Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request .
state.n | 2 | His attorney could n't be reached for comment . PRO BONO VOLUNTARISM : In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in New York state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year , the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs . The %% state %% bar association 's policy making body , the House of Delegate , voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar 's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono . `` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester , who headed the bar 's pro bono study committee .

state.n | 2 | Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has . These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before . A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and getting himself elected to the %% state %% assembly in 1965 . But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame , a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton , was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running . `` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow , '' he said at the time .
state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
state.n | 3 | Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case . They speak volumes about the %% state %% of our society at a given moment . It has always been so . In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature .
state.n | 2 | The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $ 5.2 billion . Axa has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir James 's investment vehicle , Hoylake Investments Ltd. , for $ 4.5 billion plus a $ 1 billion investment in Hoylake . Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine %% states %% where Farmers operates , and Mr. Bebear 's trip will take him to Idaho , Arizona and New York after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas .
state.n | 2 | Willie Brown , speaker of California 's Assembly , said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks . California 's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency . Both Mr. Brown , the %% state %% 's most influential legislator , and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government . According to a spokesman , the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes . Mr. Brown , meanwhile , believes `` only one tax will be feasible , and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said Chuck Dalldorf , an aide .
state.n | 2 | Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs . `` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said Quentin Kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee . Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the %% state %% over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .

state.n | 2 | When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . New York City : Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern %% states %% . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .
state.n | 2 | At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 %% states %% and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
state.n | 2 | That total would be important for Drexel . The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 %% states %% reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .
state.n | 2 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the %% states %% than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .

In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business . But in Washington %% state %% , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on children 's programs by $ 360 million , fearing the state 's 7.8 % sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays . DIALING DOLLARS : Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers .

state.n | 2 | Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue . The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' Since the spill last March , Exxon and the %% state %% have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .
state.n | 2 | `` You do n't have a right to practice . You only have a privilege to practice . '' DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th %% state %% to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states .

Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed . Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin .
state.n | 2 | Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them . William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed . The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. , have filed suit in Georgia %% state %% court against Stuart James , alleging fraud . They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .

state.n | 2 | In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances . The bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House . But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for %% state %% governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .

'' Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem . But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that %% state %% . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .
state.n | 2 | Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation , employees familiar with the project say . The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings . %% State %% engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse . The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared . Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
state.n | 2 | `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax %% states %% , such as New York or California . But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
state.n | 2 | In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase %% state %% revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
state.n | 2 | `` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . '' The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens . As a result , GOP %% state %% Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place . The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother . Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .

From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the %% state %% has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders . While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times . That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .

Keith Mulrooney , special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson , also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California , the state set tougher standards for bridges , and with federal aid , began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards .

Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its %% system %% in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings . Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and Toyota 's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring . But drivers in the U.S. must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .

He packs pork .
system.n | 1 | Here , the experience of New York City is decisive . Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians . New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this %% system %% of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it . -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
system.n | 2 | Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People 's Bank of China in Shenzhen , 15 major cases have been found , the paper said ; the biggest was the theft of $ 235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988 . The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models . But security %% systems %% , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said . Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details . Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco , the Japan Association of Travel Agents said .

system.n | 2 | New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV %% system %% . However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million . The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
system.n | 1 | The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury . BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking %% system %% , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .
system.n | 2 | The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division . FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute . The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet %% system %% installed earlier this year . State officials could n't be reached for comment late yesterday . FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling $ 22.5 million on Sept. 30 , and stockholders ' equity is $ 60.1 million .
system.n | 4 | `` NASA did it right ; that 's the message , '' said J.R. Thompson , the agency 's deputy administrator . The $ 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons . If all goes well , it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar %% system %% was formed 4.6 billion years ago . Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape . Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth , but these planets are lifeless ; Earth , on the other hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .

system.n | 2 | A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks . The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network , Mr. Redmond said . NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their %% systems %% to reject worms . But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . Michael Alexander , a senior editor at Computerworld , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name .

turn.v | 2 | Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control %% turn %% malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .
turn.v | 4 | `` But that partner is n't Fiat . '' The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division . Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have %% turned %% down the offer . News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .
turn.v | 2 | Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa 's interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98 % of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality . While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use . Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been %% turned %% into one . Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908 , the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations . When the Germans lost World War I , they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer , patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers .
turn.v | 5 | At Movieline , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . '' In restaurants ( in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres ) , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room . `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you %% turn %% it off ? '' That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) .
turn.v | 4 | There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while %% turning %% away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .

Mr. Noriega 's proposal was %% turned %% down . And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image . The end of the marriage was at hand .

turn.v | 1 | Again , the composer must select his own materials . But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials . Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have %% turned %% to similar approaches . Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation . According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' .

She had begun to %% turn %% back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .

Good luck , fellow '' . Mercer %% turned %% away . The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat . What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
turn.v | 1 | The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family . The haughty white girl %% turned %% to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier . It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' . Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .

It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman %% turn %% and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .

I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass . Then I saw the father 's head slightly %% turn %% ; ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold . Autos whizzed past . White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .
turn.v | 6 | Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . But that indictment was never made . For Tom Horn , it %% turned %% out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing . The former scout 's alibi could n't be shaken . The authorities had to release him .

I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had %% turned %% at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .
turn.v | 5 | He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to . Fearless . Every night when he wanted a drink of water , did n't he practice being fearless by not %% turning %% on the bathroom light ? ? A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he 'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I 'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad . He had n't intended to make the promise .

And I was n't .
turn.v | 2 | Perhaps that was the first thing to do . A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , %% turn %% into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .

value.n | 2 | G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy . Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand . But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose %% value %% rises when interest rates decline . Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen . `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
value.n | 2 | McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause . Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices . To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term %% value %% of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer . `` We 're very pleased with the new deal .

The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face %% value %% . The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .

So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 ) . A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
value.n | 2 | But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential %% values %% for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 .

value.n | 2 | According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden , N.J . In February 1987 , Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for $ 83.7 million -- more than $ 18 million above market price . The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market %% value %% to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer . Lawyers for shareholders , Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed . But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump , with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .
value.n | 2 | Mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated -- but only temporarily . Their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors . The shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic %% value %% of a freezer full of meat . In Texas after Hurricane Alicia , major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to Houston , no gouging , just good will . Tom Mongan
value.n | 2 | Sales were $ 623 million , up 0.5 % from $ 619.8 million a year ago . Rohm & Haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense . The company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the %% value %% of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars . In addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter . Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
value.n | 2 | In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters . The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens . The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book %% value %% of the collection { be } reduced to zero . '' In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . ''
work.v | 1 | Male scandal victims invariably fare better . Anne Burford , the former EPA chief who resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with Congress , was kayoed in the confrontation , even though she was never charged with official wrondgoing . She %% worked %% part-time as a consultant and wrote a book , but never restarted her high-powered legal career . It did n't help when , in 1986 , she was charged ( and then cleared ) on allegations of public drunkenness . `` I cut my losses and ran , '' she says , from her new home in Colorado , where she is busy remodeling .
work.v | 1 | The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs %% works %% for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .
work.v | 2 | But they think promotions are limited . THE HOUSE votes down a proposal to put pension plans under the control of joint labor-management boards . Some consultants had insisted it would n't %% work %% . LONG-TERM care insurance gains favor . More than half the people surveyed for the Employee Benefit Research Institute say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage .
work.v | 8 | More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending . The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries . Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it %% works %% out a plan for paying its debts . American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .
work.v | 2 | And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline . There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC . `` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything %% works %% for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director . Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar . These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
work.v | 2 | But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it %% work %% , '' says Mr. Anderson . What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
work.v | 1 | The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll . Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA . Although %% working %% for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively . During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .
work.v | 1 | In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some %% working %% for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .
work.v | 1 | Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below . Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity . Mrs. Balcolm %% worked %% for the brain . Mrs . Ten Eyke did mental health . Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .
work.v | 8 | Balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations . Therefore to Helva , the problem that she could n't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . She would %% work %% out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing . She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental . Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .
work.v | 8 | To his surprise his plan worked perfectly . `` All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling . `` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and %% work %% your problems '' . And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . He scarcely saw them .
work.v | 4 | She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . `` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . He saw her hand start to %% work %% down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . `` I 've had enough of that .
work.v | 1 | And then there was Linda 's engagement to Bobbie Evans . There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie was n't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who %% worked %% for the same steel company as John did . Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . It was n't even John and Edythe .
work.v | 1 | Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or Abe Spector , a process-server , we could n't determine which . His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott 's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . The grocery the youth %% worked %% for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .
