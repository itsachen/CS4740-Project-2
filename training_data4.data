affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
affect.v | 1 | But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that . Also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies . To top off the bearish factors %% affecting %% yesterday 's trading , late October weather , especially in the Northeast U.S. , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster . `` We are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' Mr. Bolling said from New York . In other commodity markets yesterday :
affect.v | 1 | This is in response to George Melloan 's Business World column `` The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think '' ( op-ed page , Sept. 26 ) . In Houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become . Unused houses deteriorate rapidly , %% affecting %% the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim . At this stage some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value . But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so .
affect.v | 1 | `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor %% affecting %% some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants . The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists , and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped .
affect.v | 1 | He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives . Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy . American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't %% affect %% their relationships with the ad agency . `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
affect.v | 1 | In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each %% affected %% employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression . He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . `` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said .
affect.v | 1 | USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely %% affect %% the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines . Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel . One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
affect.v | 1 | The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to %% affect %% the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .
affect.v | 1 | Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to %% affect %% our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
affect.v | 1 | He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere . I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's . One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Does n't %% Affect %% Us ! ! Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they 're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance . The trouble here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything .
affect.v | 1 | Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; ; but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type . Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ; and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare . Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes %% affecting %% Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature . The book concerned with the Negro 's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ; recently only Keith Wheeler 's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem . All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .
affect.v | 1 | We could n't be seen together , for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent . I could n't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . Now the Czarship had not %% affected %% my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . There , Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats .
allow.v | 1 | He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s . `` Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine , '' Mr. Boren says , referring as well to Sam Rayburn , the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower . `` They %% allowed %% this country to be credible . I really want to see that happen again . '' If this were 1949 , Mr. Boren might even succeed .
allow.v | 2 | But drivers in the U.S. must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only . And Detroit 's Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development . In the engine department , several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space , %% allowing %% for shorter hoods . In the so-called two-stroke engines , which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once to provide power . By contrast , the pistons in conventional four-stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
allow.v | 1 | The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings , mostly with Senate Democrats , to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut . The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax . According to some who attended , the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for %% allowing %% the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending . The president was said to have been noncommittal .
allow.v | 1 | The New York Stock Exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up . The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval . ESPs will %% allow %% institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ 5 million . `` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available . The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday .
allow.v | 1 | The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . But it would %% allow %% considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .
allow.v | 1 | Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat . In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice . It also %% allows %% people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world . The Japanese government does n't allow this . The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions .
allow.v | 1 | Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands . Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy . American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- %% allow %% this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share . The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way . The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
allow.v | 1 | They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will %% allow %% industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan .
allow.v | 1 | Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' %% allowing %% extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors . `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says .
allow.v | 1 | British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles . In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong , China said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony . China had refused to repatriate citizens who sneaked into Hong Kong illegally since early this month , when the colony %% allowed %% a dissident Chinese swimmer to flee to the U.S. . About 1,100 Chinese were awaiting repatriation yesterday . Italy 's Foreign Ministry said it is investigating exports to the Soviet Union by an Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. subsidiary called OCN-PPL that makes numerically controlled machine tools .
allow.v | 1 | No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly . But it 's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett did n't manage to boost SCI TV 's operating profit after the buy-out . Mr. Kravis apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again , %% allowing %% SCI TV to sell assets to pay debt . Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a Detroit station . As for junk-holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR .
allow.v | 2 | Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to %% allow %% for the settlement of claims . Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .

'' DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would %% allow %% it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
allow.v | 1 | In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . '' After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded . Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red %% allowed %% residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes . Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness . Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows .
allow.v | 1 | President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , %% allowing %% him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
allow.v | 1 | But gay rights advocates are angry , too . The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family . `` It 's certainly discrimination , '' says attorney Evan Wolfson , whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that %% allowed %% travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members .

Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . `` Once people got into it , I was %% allowing %% them to live a dream , '' he says . He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says . `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . ''
allow.v | 1 | If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . Hewlett-Packard claims that the software %% allows %% a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
allow.v | 1 | The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered . A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong . Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to %% allow %% downtown redevelopment . But Beijing wants to use the base for the People 's Liberation Army after 1997 , when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty . Ke Zaishuo , head of China 's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong , accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said , `` This is something we can not accept .

allow.v | 1 | I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , %% allow %% psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now .
allow.v | 1 | Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ? Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we can not clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? ? What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not %% allow %% themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ? Is n't all art ambiguous ? ? `` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine .

He respected each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull . Yet he never %% allowed %% these models to become fixed in his mind ; ; they remained rough starting points . When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model . The true surge had to be inside the marble itself .

The Canadian application is expected to be %% announced %% in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . `` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently .

announce.v | 1 | The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire %% announced %% it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri .

The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was %% announced %% at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .

An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have %% announced %% similar increases . Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said .
announce.v | 1 | When the Soviets %% announced %% their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February , the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria . It was `` the Soviets ' Vietnam . '' The Kabul regime would fall .
announce.v | 1 | There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , %% announces %% an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ; that is to say , to the churchyard '' . And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction . The highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .
announce.v | 1 | The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome . On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses . The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by %% announcing %% : `` Today I go see the horses '' . It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .
announce.v | 1 | `` Okay , I 'm Happy . Where do I start '' ? ? Jubal did not hear of Digby 's disappearance when it was %% announced %% , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; ; if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered . His household had gone through an upset . Jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to inquire .
announce.v | 2 | He had lots of friends , then as always . Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend . No man 's name brought more cheers when it was %% announced %% in a rodeo . `` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin ' you was a nester swingin ' the long rope ? ? Which would you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down '' ? ?
announce.v | 1 | There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie was n't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did . Some people said Linda had just %% announced %% the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . It was n't even John and Edythe . It was simply Poor John .
announce.v | 1 | More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband 's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to %% announce %% to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .
approve.v | 1 | It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol . But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves . If the FDA %% approves %% the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products . `` It 's going to be a sensational thing , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay . Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel : `` I just got back yesterday from the U.S. .
approve.v | 1 | The legislation was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health . Michigan 's Senate passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania 's House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy . The FDA is expected to %% approve %% today a program granting access free of charge to the drug AZT for children with AIDS . Adults have had access to the only approved antiviral drug since 1987 . Research shows AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , 1,859 of whom are known to have been infected .
approve.v | 1 | The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA %% approved %% the drug 's usage for adults in March 1987 . But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
approve.v | 1 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also %% approved %% was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
approve.v | 1 | The House %% approved %% a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law . By a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters , and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress .
approve.v | 1 | Lotus Development Corp. feeds its evaluations into a computer , but only for storage ; the decisions are made by supervisors . Hershey Foods Corp. strives for fairness by basing increases on quarterly reviews , annual appraisals and meetings with workers . At Chemfix Technology Inc. , each supervisor 's recommendation must be %% approved %% by the next boss up the line , and then sanctioned by a salary review committee . JAPANESE COMPANIES fare best in U.S. when they give Americans more say . University of Michigan researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning , product development and design , including decision-making back in Japan .
approve.v | 1 | In Warsaw , Shevardnadze held his first talks with the Solidarity-led government and vowed to maintain fuel supplies . Poland 's premier is to visit Moscow next month . The Arab League pledged an accord for a complete Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon , where about 70,000 people marched to the headquarters of Christian leader Aoun to support his rejection of a peace plan %% approved %% Sunday by Lebanon 's legislature . The plan lacked a withdrawal timetable . Pro-Iranian kidnappers renewed an offer to trade their captives in Lebanon for at least 15 Shiite Moslem comrades jailed in Kuwait .
approve.v | 1 | The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . '' Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . Use of dispersants was %% approved %% when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .
approve.v | 1 | President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is %% approved %% by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has . `` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request .
approve.v | 1 | On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange . At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor ( $ 386 million ) to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say . The board had also been expected to %% approve %% a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 ( $ 4.48 ) to SKr205 ( $ 31.65 ) in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .
approve.v | 1 | A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag . While the proposal won a slight majority , the 51-48 vote was well short of the two-thirds needed to %% approve %% changes in the Constitution . It was considered a victory for Democratic leaders , who favor a law barring flag burning . The House approved an $ 837 million aid package for Poland and Hungary , nearly double what Bush had requested .
approve.v | 1 | Honecker 's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule . HUNGARY ADOPTED constitutional changes to form a democratic system . At a nationally televised legislative session in Budapest , the Parliament overwhelmingly %% approved %% changes formally ending one-party domination in the country , regulating free elections by next summer and establishing the office of state president to replace a 21-member council . The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary . Like other Soviet bloc nations , it had been known as a `` people 's republic '' since
approve.v | 2 | She sang him Scott 's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment . She had never sung better . `` Your voice is delightful '' , he %% approved %% with a warm smile . `` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale . There have been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals '' .
area.n | 3 | Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines . At the State University of New York at Brooklyn , researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs . Between flashes , certain %% areas %% in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator . When the jolt is timed just right , the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters . `` Where does that first stimulus go ? '' exclaims SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee .
area.n | 1 | Manville and the trust are discussing the offer , but no decision has been made . The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market ; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock ; or a recapitalization of Manville . The Soviet Union 's jobless rate is soaring to 27 % in some %% areas %% , Pravda said . It said the situation is caused by efforts to streamline bloated factory payrolls . Unemployment has reached 27.6 % in Azerbaijan , 25.7 % in Tadzhikistan , 22.8 % in Uzbekistan , 18.8 % in Turkmenia , 18 % in Armenia and 16.3 % in Kirgizia , the Communist Party newspaper said .
area.n | 1 | `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . '' Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities . That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban %% areas %% . Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says Maurice Geiger , founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier , Vt. , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
area.n | 2 | Unocal Corp. , Los Angeles , said it and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. would create a petroleum marketing and refining general partnership in the Midwest . The joint venture , Uno-Ven Co. , would generate total annual revenue of about $ 500 million and have 1,100 employees , a Unocal spokesman said . Unocal said the venture would enable it to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration , production , chemicals and other %% areas %% . It said financing would consist of $ 250 million from a private placement obtained through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $ 150 million revolving credit line underwritten by Chase Manhattan Bank . In addition to Unocal 's 153,000 barrel-a-day refinery near Lemont , Ill. , the new venture would control 17 distribution terminals , a lubricating-oil blending and packaging plant , and 131 company-owned Unocal service stations .
area.n | 1 | The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $ 3.6 million over six years , as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years , based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures , '' the Times said . The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter . The settlement , which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York %% area %% , will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system . Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times 's 1.1 million daily circulation . Currently , about 60 % of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times .
area.n | 3 | Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer . The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell . By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact %% area %% as in the first copy of the chromosome . The finding riveted medicine . It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer .
area.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade %% areas %% , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
area.n | 2 | Independent providers of financial information , including Quotron , have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue . Shearson , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data . The job cuts , to be made in a number of %% areas %% at various job levels , are `` a streamlining of operations , '' a spokeswoman said . The company has no immediate plans to close any operations , she said , but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house , including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data . The spokeswoman said the move is n't directly a response to Quotron 's loss of its two biggest customers , Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year .
area.n | 2 | It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number . Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off . Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital %% areas %% such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado . Analysts also say it 's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $ 115 billion foreign debt , on which it suspended interest payments last month . Analysts say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food items .
area.n | 2 | In August , representatives of Keidanren , Japan 's largest business organization , visited Moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy . Out of the blue , the Soviet Chamber of Commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want to buy . These mainly involved such %% areas %% as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such as artificial blood vessels . A main motive is hard cash . But , while the Soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from Japan , they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise .
area.n | 1 | Stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds . One was that , despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due . The other is that he 's an Oakland native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit %% areas %% last week . Afterward , as the A 's toasted their victory with beer ( they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims ) , Stewart said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy . `` Give me four or five more Series with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young , '' he said , in reference to baseball 's best-pitcher award .

Or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums . Farmers in the Midwest and other %% areas %% have suffered , but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery . And when they were no longer needed , they were turned loose unprepared to build lives of their own . Denton Harris

area.n | 1 | Presidio , a Denver oil and gas concern , said it will acquire the properties and operations of Home Petroleum Corp. , which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas . Presidio said the properties are generally situated in Wyoming , North Dakota , Texas , Oklahoma and Louisiana . Gulf Canada , Calgary , said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on Canada , Indonesia and other international %% areas %% . A spokesman for Gulf Canada , which is controlled by Toronto 's Reichmann family , said the properties account for about 6 % of the company 's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day . He said Gulf Canada will likely report an extraordinary gain from the sale in the fourth quarter , but he would n't offer a specific estimate .
area.n | 1 | Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports . The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s , however , forcing the bank to face competition . At the same time , many of Spain 's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing %% areas %% faced a sharp decline in economic growth . As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .
area.n | 1 | I was impressed by the perceptiveness of your Sept. 12 story `` Rural Enterprise : Tough Row To Hoe . '' We lived in rural %% areas %% many years , but now live in St. Louis County , Mo . This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey , I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening . The presence of so many people , cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live .
area.n | 1 | Last week , the government took three bills to the National Assembly . The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system . Highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation 's six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural %% areas %% . The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property . -- A tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .

Lichtblau , the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service stations pump fuel into cars . In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive %% areas %% believed to have vast reserves . Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil .

area.n | 1 | To ask those questions is to answer them . Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government . The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons , and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the %% area %% do . Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress , who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it . Congress is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit .

area.n | 1 | Computer Associates International , the most active Big Board issue , was another victim of an earnings-related sell-off . The stock fell 3\/4 to 12 7\/8 as 3.6 million shares were traded in the wake of its report that fiscal second-quarter net income fell 66 % from a year ago . Insurance stocks moved higher in the wake of a strong third-quarter earnings report from Chubb , coming on the heels of speculation that last week 's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco %% area %% would lead to higher premium rates . Chubb , whose net income for the quarter exceeded most analysts ' expectations , rallied 3 3\/4 to 86 1\/2 .

Town & Country Ford in Charlotte , N.C. , still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks . Business had been fairly strong until Hurricane Hugo hit the %% area %% , but has been down since .

area.n | 2 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all %% areas %% saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
area.n | 1 | Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled . Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe . Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard %% areas %% than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
area.n | 2 | Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered . For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . '' Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million , $ 200,000 annual income , or recent experience in the business %% area %% of the franchise being sold . But critics consider the changes regressive . Lewis G. Rudnick , a Chicago lawyer who represents franchisers , contends California is narrowly limiting -- rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales .

San Francisco Bay %% area %% officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
area.n | 1 | Secretary of State Baker , in his first major arms-control speech , called for a new military relationship with Moscow to reduce `` first strike '' nuclear arms . BAY AREA COMMUTERS BATTLED earthquake-related transportation snarls . Travelers crowded into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited for buses in the rain , but the massive gridlock anticipated by officials in the San Francisco Bay %% area %% never materialized . As the death toll from last week 's temblor climbed to 61 , the condition of freeway survivor Buck Helm , who spent four days trapped under rubble , improved , hospital officials said . Rescue crews , however , gave up hope that others would be found alive under the collapsed roadway .
area.n | 1 | Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space . It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area . Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay %% area %% , including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area . The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments . The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year .
area.n | 1 | The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school . The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away . Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to %% area %% hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise . The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said . The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts .
area.n | 2 | He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers . `` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says . `` They are n't prepared to compete in an %% area %% where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
area.n | 1 | This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake . Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay %% area %% neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system . The Bay Bridge , the main artery into San Francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks . Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
area.n | 1 | A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts %% area %% are doing almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
area.n | 3 | These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group 's Grand Boulevard Plaza . Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center . Security is 60 % to 70 % of the common %% area %% charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 % . These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing . Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
area.n | 1 | These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city %% areas %% may represent a major new untapped market for investment . New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
area.n | 1 | In Chicago , for example , size is the issue . `` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization . `` We 're in a metro %% area %% with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . '' When the lease expires in 1999 , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . '' This year , the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp , down from 120 , in a move meant to trim payroll costs .
area.n | 1 | Among other technology issues , Cray Research rose 1 5\/8 to 37 , Hewlett-Packard added 1 1\/4 to 50 1\/4 , Tandem Computers rallied 1 1\/8 to 25 3\/4 , Data General rose 3\/4 to 14 1\/2 and Motorola gained 2 3\/8 to 59 1\/4 . On the other hand , Symbol Technologies dropped 1 1\/4 to 18 1\/2 after Shearson Lehman Hutton lowered its short-term investment rating on the stock and its 1989 earnings estimate , and Commodore International fell 7\/8 to 8 after the company said it expects to post a loss for the September quarter . Insurance stocks continued to climb on expectations that premium rates will rise in the aftermath of the earthquake in the San Francisco %% area %% . American International Group climbed 4 to 106 5\/8 , General Re rose 3 1\/8 to 89 5\/8 , Kemper added 2 1\/2 to 48 , AON went up 1 3\/8 to 36 and Chubb rose 1 1\/4 to 82 1\/4 . Stocks of major toy makers rallied in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports .
area.n | 1 | But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando . Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't , he says . In his %% area %% , Mr. Lackey continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work . But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors . The IRS assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
area.n | 1 | CalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles %% area %% real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million . CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
area.n | 1 | The rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . As rescuers pressed their efforts after finding a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay %% area %% girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . In Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . Estimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion .
area.n | 1 | What if it happened to us ? In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo , many companies in disaster-prone %% areas %% are pondering the question of preparedness . Some , particularly in West Coast earthquake zones , are dusting off their evacuation plans , checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes . Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
area.n | 1 | The prisons are too crowded . Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . '' Mr. Bennett declined to name the %% area %% officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem . But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city .
area.n | 1 | But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much . Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria %% area %% and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December . For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
area.n | 2 | Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios . Those portfolios are remarkably diversified . By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one %% area %% , be it stocks , bonds or real estate . For example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock ( down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year ) . But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
area.n | 2 | Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines . Medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases . Car prices , another %% area %% that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month , still showed declines at the consumer level . They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers . Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row , far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
area.n | 1 | The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay %% area %% is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings , officials at the two major rating agencies said . Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties , and `` there are potential isolated problems , '' said Hyman Grossman , a managing director . The agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry .
area.n | 1 | Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow . The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem . Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the %% area %% 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours . Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . ''

area.n | 1 | A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big , untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta %% area %% of the western Canadian Arctic . Three companies , Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 . To be economically feasible , the 11 billion Canadian dollar ( US$ 9.37 billion ) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
area.n | 1 | `` We regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city , '' Mr. Fitzwater said . By late yesterday , both sides appeared prepared to bury the hatchet . The White House announced that Mr. Agnos , along with the mayors of Oakland and Alameda , are to accompany President Bush on a tour of the earthquake %% area %% today . And one White House official reported that Mr. Agnos had been `` very helpful '' in making arrangements for Mr. Bush 's hastily scheduled trip to California .
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
area.n | 2 | But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones . In the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses . Commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other %% areas %% -- mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its Amiga , which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with Apple Computer Inc. or International Business Machines Corp. hardware . But sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months , even in West Germany , which has been by far Commodore 's strongest market . The Commodore 64 and 128 , mainly used for children 's educational software and games , had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low-profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory .
area.n | 1 | Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home . The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually all businesses shut down . The $ 125-billion-a-year Bay %% area %% economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services , according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto . In high-tech , the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry . `` This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy , '' says Pauline Sweezey , the chief economist at the California Department of Finance .
area.n | 1 | `` Obviously , things are going to have to go on hold for many companies . '' The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship . A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day , far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system ( BART ) -- which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the %% area %% was being checked for gas leaks . California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area . All major roadways except Interstate 880 , known as the Nimitz Freeway , and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday .
area.n | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion . The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up . William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay %% area %% , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product .
area.n | 1 | But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property . The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance . A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay %% area %% have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n't covered . Earthquake insurance typically runs $ 200 or more a year for a small house . Whatever the long-term economic effect , the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy .
area.n | 1 | Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area . About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks . Some adjusters , already in other parts of California , drove to the disaster %% area %% with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers . Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims . State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
area.n | 1 | Officials from the American Insurance Association 's property-claim service division , which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster , will be flying to San Francisco today . They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two . Roads and bridges in the Bay %% area %% appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage . Highways , such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland , generally do n't have insurance coverage . Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage , either , so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds .
area.n | 1 | And if I think that some people { on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 's } staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown , I have to tell you something -- I 'm not going to take it . I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here . And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our %% area %% . And if we 're not ombudsman for our area , we ought to be thrown out of office . On the other hand , if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story .
area.n | 1 | Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday . Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay %% area %% , a spot check of computer makers turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment . Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods . Intel Corp. , Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take the day off .
area.n | 1 | `` It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way , '' said Sally Stewart , a spokeswoman for the Red Cross . `` It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget . '' The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay %% area %% , serving 5,000 people . Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states . All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA , agency officials said .
area.n | 1 | The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days . And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period . One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay %% area %% , facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers . Even before the full extent of the devastation was known , Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance . By yesterday afternoon , Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies , physicians , communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California .
area.n | 2 | But many investors remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers . `` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . `` I think the problems in the junk-bond %% area %% are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds . In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. DeVoe added . `` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''
area.n | 1 | Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem , however . `` People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted , '' said a spokesman for the American Automobile Association . Tom Schumacher , executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento , said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay %% area %% yesterday , except for emergency-medical supplies . `` Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday , '' he said . `` Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed , but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes .
area.n | 1 | `` We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down . '' Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station , which sustained `` heavy structural damage '' during the quake . The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento , relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay %% area %% . Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday . Rail-transit operations suffered little damage , according to Albert Engelken , deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington .
area.n | 1 | All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage . The two that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage . State officials said the court 's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the %% area %% . `` This project is ready to move , '' said State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese . But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain .
area.n | 1 | Intel also added 3\/8 to 33 7\/8 . But Sun Microsystems slipped 1\/4 to 17 1\/4 . Shares of biotechnology companies in the %% area %% were also higher . Chiron was up 1\/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1\/2 to 16 3\/8 . The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved , too .
area.n | 1 | West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets . At the opening of the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate for November delivery shot up 10 cents a barrel , to $ 20.85 , still on the belief that the refineries were damaged . In the San Francisco %% area %% , roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude , about a third of all the refining capacity in California , is processed daily , according to industry data . For more than the past year , even the rumor of a major West Coast refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight . But yesterday , as the morning wore on , some major West Coast refinery operators -- including Chevron Corp. , Exxon Corp. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group -- said their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally .
area.n | 1 | CALIFORNIA STRUGGLED with the aftermath of a Bay %% area %% earthquake . As aftershocks shook the San Francisco Bay area , rescuers searched through rubble for survivors of Tuesday 's temblor , and residents picked their way through glass-strewn streets . In Oakland , hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway .
area.n | 1 | Could the collapse of I-880 have been prevented ? That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday 's temblor . After touring the %% area %% , California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the Associated Press reported . The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives . But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor .
area.n | 1 | The calls reached many , but certainly not all , of the publicly held companies with operations in the area . In most cases damage to company facilities and operations was minimal . ADIA SERVICES INC. , Menlo Park , temporary personnel agency , annual sales of $ 504 million , OTC , said all 30 offices in Bay %% area %% were working , but in various states of disarray . Business was slow because many companies were closed yesterday . ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC. , Sunnyvale , integrated circuit maker , annual sales of $ 1.12 billion , NYSE , had only minor structural damage .
area.n | 1 | BUSINESSLAND INC. , San Jose , computer retail company , annual sales of $ 1.1 billion , NYSE , said all 16 corporate office and stores in the area were open with the exception of a retail center in San Francisco 's business district . That facility should reopen today . CARTER HAWLEY HALE STORES Inc. , Los Angeles , retailer , annual sales of $ 2.79 billion , NYSE , said nine of its 22 Emporium stores in the %% area %% were closed because of water damage , broken windows and fallen displays . A spokesman said sales are expected to be hurt , but the losses are covered by insurance . CHEVRON CORP. , San Francisco , oil company , annual sales of $ 25.2 billion , NYSE , had minor damage to downtown headquarters , but structural damage closed two of its seven buildings in San Ramone industrial park .
area.n | 1 | It also was n't known what the impact will be on the division 's work , which includes the Navy 's Trident submarine-based missile program and the Air Force 's Strategic Defense Initiative . The division had only minor damage at its Sunnyvale headquarters and plant in Palo Altos , and no delays in deliveries are expected . LONGS DRUG STORES INC. , Walnut Creek , drugstore chain , annual sales of $ 1.9 billion , NYSE , had only minor damage and only four of its 75 Bay-area stores , all in the Santa Cruz %% area %% , were closed . All are expected to reopen soon . LSI LOGIC CORP. , Milpitas , maker of customized integrated circuits , annual sales of $ 550 million , NYSE , has halted manufacturing at its three plants in the area while they are inspected for structural damage .
area.n | 2 | Gold tried to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold . `` December delivery gold is trading in a range of $ 365 to $ 375 { an ounce } and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' Mr. Savaiko said . `` Producers at the moment regard that %% area %% a good one in which to sell gold . '' Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . '' Jeffrey Nichols , president of APMS Canada , Toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal .
area.n | 2 | The comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain %% areas %% of wholesale banking . Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said .
area.n | 1 | In filing an original ( not amended ) return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately . THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims . Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday , but the IRS says people in the disaster %% areas %% wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` Hugo '' and postmarked by Jan. 16 . Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability . IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims .
area.n | 3 | Despite the number of fans that office massage has won , some purists look down on it , arguing that naked , full-body rubs are the only way to go . Linda Aldridge , who does full-body work in Pittsburgh , says that while on-site massage is better than nothing , tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg . `` Whole %% areas %% of their bodies are neglected , '' she says , adding that clothes ruin the experience . `` There 's nothing like skin to skin .
ask.v | 1 | Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? Here is a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced the leader , the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement . In either case , %% ask %% yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience . If you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course . Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973 .
ask.v | 2 | This month , the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday , in various forms , ingest too much psyllium . Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war . The FDA has %% asked %% Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe . It also ordered P&G to produce more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol . But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves .
ask.v | 2 | All other countries registered support below 50 % . The Israeli Manufacturers ' Association filed a police complaint against an Arab pasta maker for using the four colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag on spaghetti packages . `` We %% asked %% police to investigate why they are allowed to distribute the flag in this way .

ask.v | 1 | Is n't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. Laff for this crime was the least that you planned for him ? '' Mr. Lorin responded , `` No .

ask.v | 1 | `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really %% asking %% is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says . Then , he answers his own question . `` Yes , they are .
ask.v | 2 | Thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it . Meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished . To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most , the Journal %% asked %% a completely unscientific , random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail . Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose . They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses .
ask.v | 2 | Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down . `` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said Steve Burzon , publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home . And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , said advertisers are frequently %% asked %% to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , president of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
ask.v | 1 | Separately , the New York Times reported that the Israeli government had provided its correspondent in Jerusalem with different documents that Israel said prove the PLO has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories . The State Department said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers . `` If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' Mr. Carmon %% asked %% . Israel has long claimed Mr. Arafat never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the Jewish state . Now , Jerusalem says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat .
ask.v | 1 | State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed ( Drexel ) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and %% asked %% for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''
ask.v | 1 | It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs . There is , after all , big money in environmentalism . Maybe we should %% ask %% why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs . Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all . One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .
ask.v | 1 | The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization . The two surveys , which %% asked %% different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples .

The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
ask.v | 2 | `` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he says . Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol . `` I guess I might have %% asked %% Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame . `` After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries . And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . ''
ask.v | 2 | Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . Washington rejected the bid , saying the hostages were n't linked to other issues . PLO leader Arafat %% asked %% Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said .

Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from drugs to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . ''
ask.v | 1 | Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the WPP takeover brought them closer together . `` I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him { to Mr. Sorrell } as my successor . Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. Roman %% asked %% . He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut . Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units .
ask.v | 2 | All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . '' Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . '' Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm %% asking %% people to broaden their agendas . '' The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College . He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale .
ask.v | 2 | The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers . But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million . Industry executives said Philip Morris had %% asked %% the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share . According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year . The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said .

Mr. Bush %% asked %% Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
ask.v | 3 | The New York Stock Exchange said a seat was sold for $ 500,000 , unchanged from the sale Thursday . Seats are quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 %% asked %% .
ask.v | 3 | The previous sale was $ 436,000 on Oct. 17 ; the last time prices were that low was November 1985 , when a seat sold for $ 425,000 . Prices peaked at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 . Seats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 %% asked %% .
ask.v | 2 | Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other . Called Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker %% asks %% other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
ask.v | 1 | Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . He talked about 20 minutes .

ask.v | 2 | Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people ? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey %% asked %% for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans . Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey is n't really part of Europe .
ask.v | 2 | It is not easy to become Segovia 's pupil . One needs high talent . Segovia has written about Carl : `` His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he %% asked %% for my help in disciplining them . I found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught . There has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus I accepted him as my pupil .
ask.v | 2 | Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg . He `` legitimized '' Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles . Victor Berger , the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress , had %% asked %% Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English . Carl , who was stationed in Appleton , Wisconsin , organizing for the Social Democrats , was in Berger 's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar . She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton , Illinois .
ask.v | 1 | Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' . Under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers . Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright 's remarks to reporters when he was %% asked %% , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole . First , Wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town . But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? ?
ask.v | 1 | The story ends in the child 's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother . The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside . I had read the story many times without %% asking %% myself why it affected me or caring why it did . But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story . It was , of course , a little boy 's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .
ask.v | 2 | In `` The King 's Ride '' , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years . He finds it in utter misery and desolation . All his people %% ask %% for is no more war . But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died . He had become king at fifteen .
ask.v | 1 | I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . And why not ? ? How , I %% asked %% , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ? If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .
ask.v | 2 | Then he thought me more perverse than ever . I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi . On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one %% asked %% for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees . One does not have to look for distress . It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' .
ask.v | 2 | You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' . Others mentioned that I might have had to %% ask %% friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears . Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
ask.v | 1 | Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ? Will the danger increase or decrease ? ? I have just %% asked %% these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .
ask.v | 1 | She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is '' ? ? `` No '' , said Wilson , `` I do n't . I was just %% asking %% about it . What is it '' ? ? `` It 's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates .
ask.v | 2 | Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids '' . It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children . Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and %% ask %% him to repeat . He said , `` Nothing '' . And then : `` There are lots of kids around here '' .
ask.v | 2 | His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son . After a pause , during which he studied Scotty 's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs . Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would %% ask %% him to repeat . `` I 'm eating more '' , he would say . Or : `` I walk around the house a lot '' .
ask.v | 2 | Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her ? ? Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? ? Should I accompany her to the door of her home , or should I %% ask %% to be invited in ? ? In or out , should I kiss her goodnight ? ? All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year ! !
ask.v | 1 | Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada . Finally she had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . `` How do you like it '' ? ? She had %% asked %% . Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' . `` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
ask.v | 1 | What had once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans . What hope lay in the nephews , she %% asked %% the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ? ? She ate . It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table 's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .
ask.v | 2 | She concluded by %% asking %% him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . The fish took the bait . He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .
ask.v | 1 | `` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' . `` I 'll tell you nothing . I do n't %% ask %% you who 't- is you 're being unfaithful to , husband or lover . Frankly , I do n't care '' . For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind .
ask.v | 2 | At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to %% ask %% Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
ask.v | 1 | I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' `` I understand '' . Styka blew his nose again . `` Were you able to make the arrangements '' ? ? Andrei %% asked %% . `` There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek . I did exactly as instructed .
ask.v | 1 | I wish our doctor could have saved her '' . `` It was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton . `` Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg '' ? ? She %% asked %% him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak . `` As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly . He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .
ask.v | 2 | `` Leave me your address . I will send you the best the quarter has to offer '' . Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo 's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , %% asked %% the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna . Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch . Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .
ask.v | 1 | The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and %% asked %% if there was anything he could do for them . Harold shook his head . `` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .
ask.v | 1 | McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook . He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file . `` Sleep well '' ? ? He %% asked %% . Andrus did not answer him . His face was bloated with drugging , redder than normal .
ask.v | 1 | What now ? ? Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned . `` Plot '' ? ? John %% asked %% tiredly . `` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit . I went to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here .
ask.v | 1 | All these emotions were screwed up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King 's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau . Imagine the honor of it ! ! `` What was your answer '' ? ? Jean Jacques %% asked %% , striving to appear unimpressed . `` I refused '' , Duclos said . `` What else could I do ? ?
ask.v | 1 | So what ? ? Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ? ( he %% asked %% this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) . Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him . He could n't make out what he was saying .
ask.v | 1 | We do n't 'low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come from . `` The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' . `` What did the Colonel do about the men '' ? ? Jane %% asked %% in her placid , interested way . Mickie laughed . `` He recommended both of them for the DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart , too , for a combat-inflicted wound .
ask.v | 1 | He remembered them well from his happy period . Formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them . He tried to %% ask %% the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again . She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body . She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech .
ask.v | 1 | Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin . He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it . Only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not %% ask %% B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it . Fighting pleasure itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there . B'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway .
ask.v | 1 | `` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ? Tanner wisecracked . `` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners . `` Are you my partner '' ? ?

ask.v | 1 | He was the captain , so he could ask questions like that . `` Some can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said elaborately . `` What will we need outside , Ryan '' ? ? Ekstrohm %% asked %% . `` No helmets '' , the captain answered . `` We can breathe out there , all right .
ask.v | 2 | What Gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws . The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man 's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature . The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was %% asking %% him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust . Nothing less would serve . And it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war .
ask.v | 1 | He did n't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending . The boy licked his dry lips . He %% asked %% , `` Could we have a drink '' ? ? Morgan jerked his head toward the front door . `` In the kitchen '' , he said .
ask.v | 1 | When they had licked the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette . Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad . `` How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ? Ernie %% asked %% . Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply . But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , `` My father .
ask.v | 1 | Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did . At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball . `` Why ai n't you playin ' ball '' ? ? He %% asked %% Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse . `` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called . `` I 'd druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .
ask.v | 1 | `` The kid has no manners , boys . Shall we teach him some '' ? ? His gun was half drawn when he %% asked %% the question , but the weapon never left its holster . Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin . His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .
ask.v | 1 | `` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said . Waddell turned to face him . `` No '' ? ? He %% asked %% . `` But that 's what he told me . Why , that 's his main reason for making the dive '' .
ask.v | 6 | He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps . The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America . `` Join me in another '' ? ? He had %% asked %% . `` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously . `` I do not drink so much '' .
ask.v | 2 | He belched , he stretched . Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away . Twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the Grafin 's pension , her tears dried , signing a hotel form and %% asking %% for a bath . Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities . She had retreated to this world .
ask.v | 1 | They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds . They finished the small bottle of Steinhager . She confessed she was unhappy , he %% asked %% was it her husband ? ? She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please do n't judge all poets '' .
ask.v | 1 | Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle . Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober 's part in recent events . `` Gyp Carmer could n't have known about Colcord 's money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him '' ? ? He %% asked %% himself . `` It 's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money . How much of an accident could that be '' ? ?
ask.v | 2 | `` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin ' coward face-to-face '' ! ! He exploded . `` That 's all I %% ask %% '' ! ! He never got that chance . For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .
ask.v | 1 | `` Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres ' saloon '' . Barton cursed under his breath . After another long pause he %% asked %% , `` How many people know who they are '' ? ? `` Everyone . Your cousin Finley saw to that .
ask.v | 2 | Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she %% asked %% for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
ask.v | 1 | I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die . I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make . The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I %% asked %% it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands . The snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods .
ask.v | 1 | His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She %% asked %% him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
ask.v | 2 | A man had to have his release -- at least that 's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I was n't providing it for Johnnie . Neither was his wife . She would n't have , even if he 'd %% asked %% her . But he would n't ask her -- he was n't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will . And he would n't leave her either -- he 'd told me that .
ask.v | 1 | She was even more miserable than me . Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them . `` Now is n't it better to smile '' ? ? She %% asked %% . Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ? I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
ask.v | 1 | It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed . There were bloodspots on the sheet . `` What 's this '' ? ? I %% asked %% . `` Your period '' ? ? She shook her head .
ask.v | 2 | I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , would n't it ? ? What she 'd said was true -- in all these years , she 'd never %% asked %% for anything from me . If I let her go , she 'd disappear once more . And Gladdy would be safe ! !
ask.v | 1 | `` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? ? Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ? Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy %% asked %% , `` Mother , do you know something I do n't know '' ? ? Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do . Just before Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy , and she did n't realize I was near '' .
ask.v | 1 | Abruptly he reached into his pocket . Yes , there was the key . `` Are you positive you 'll be all right by yourself '' ? ? She %% asked %% him . For a moment he smiled . `` Yes , Julie dear .
ask.v | 1 | She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little . `` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ? `` Me '' ? ? She %% asked %% , turning slowly . `` What about me '' ? ? `` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
ask.v | 1 | A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . `` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll %% ask %% the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . There 's so little to do '' .
ask.v | 1 | In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne . It is not their avoidance that rankles ; ; it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so coolly and walk away , that it hurts . I could tell them , but no one ever %% asked %% , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body . No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . She haunted me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .
ask.v | 2 | The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps . He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish . Rachel said , `` He %% asks %% for money '' . She passed by him . I reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin .
ask.v | 1 | That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ? Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice . `` How did you get by the desk '' ? ? He %% asked %% curiously . `` I 'm sure the hotel does n't know you 're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers ' doors and talking down Eskimos '' . `` Oh , I just come once a week .
ask.v | 1 | Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town . Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine . Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , %% asked %% quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on . `` See for yourself , Miss Zion . It will n't take a minute '' .
ask.v | 1 | There 's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . However one looks at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . The inventory you acquired from me is n't going to be easy to move ; ; you ca n't very well sidle up to people on the street and %% ask %% if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva . Additionally , since you 're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , Delhi boil , the Granville wilt , liver fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you 've aroused , you must n't expect to be lionized socially . My advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you 're attracted by the exotic , pass it up -- it 's nothing but a headache .
ask.v | 1 | `` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . `` This is a warm-up '' . `` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ? %% Asked %% one of the children . `` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped . One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions .
ask.v | 1 | `` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll . Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ? `` Can I bear it '' ? ? I %% asked %% , taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass . `` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : `` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings '' . Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God 's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' .
ask.v | 1 | It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was %% asked %% whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ?
ask.v | 1 | The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' . A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . `` What are my chances for taking Joe 's place '' ? ? He %% asked %% . `` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it 's all right with me '' . The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite .
attempt.v | 1 | For one thing , Pentagon officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time persuading Europeans to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out . At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe . Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever %% attempted %% . So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? ''
attempt.v | 1 | Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players . Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by %% attempting %% to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say . Time officials declined to comment . Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers .
attempt.v | 1 | In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off . Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection ( taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies ) and to deny new credit to defaulters . These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that %% attempt %% to offset market imperfections . 3 . Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget . Since the budget measures cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back .
attempt.v | 1 | They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't %% attempt %% to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
attempt.v | 1 | Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been %% attempting %% to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
attempt.v | 1 | The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal . TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback . The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court dismissed six lawsuits %% attempting %% to block a $ 2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in Manhattan . Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of New York , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines . All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage .
attempt.v | 1 | The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had %% attempted %% to make it a successorship by inheritance . It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation .
attempt.v | 1 | The white men died . And countless others like them have died . Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who %% attempted %% nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died . The aborigine is not deceived ; ; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless . He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful .
attempt.v | 1 | `` Nate '' ! ! He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him . `` I ai n't going to fight you no more '' . Nate turned his head , %% attempting %% to speak in a soothing voice . `` I know you ai n't '' ! ! Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall . He moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate 's head and clamped it on his own .
attempt.v | 1 | Everything about the clerk was trivial . Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall . Noticing my disappointment he %% attempted %% to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person . With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air . When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .
authority.n | 3 | Here are two cases to illustrate . Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car . The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the %% authorities %% carry them away . Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack . There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital .
authority.n | 3 | The two leaders are expected to discuss changes sweeping the East bloc as well as human-rights issues , regional disputes and economic cooperation . Israel 's army lifted a blockade around a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank , ending a 42-day campaign of seizing cars , furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott . While residents claimed a victory , military %% authorities %% said they had confiscated the equivalent of more than $ 1.5 million to make up for the unpaid taxes . East German leader Krenz arrived in Moscow for talks today with Gorbachev on restructuring proposals . In East Berlin , Communist Party officials considered legalizing New Forum , the country 's largest opposition alliance , as about 20,000 demonstrators staged protests in three cities to press demands for democratic freedoms .
authority.n | 3 | In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow { it } to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . '' The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks . First Union , with assets of about $ 32 billion , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory %% authorities %% . The bank added that it believes the review will `` demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act . '' The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger .
authority.n | 3 | Valued at $ 1.3 million , it was part of a four-crate shipment . The air-waybill number was changed en route , and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced , so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing . Although Heathrow %% authorities %% have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time , the Gauguin may be `` lost . '' Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said , `` It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted . '' Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree .
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
authority.n | 1 | During the coming months , layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous . For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , Mobil said . `` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the %% authority %% and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit . Field offices at New Orleans ; Houston ; Denver ; Midland , Tex. ; Bakersfield , Calif. ; Oklahoma City ; and Liberal , Kan. , will be maintained . But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased .
authority.n | 3 | But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies . Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left . New York %% authorities %% , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it . `` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development . Meanwhile , Dallas welcomed the move .
authority.n | 3 | In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves . Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil . Until the tanker spill , Big Oil was slowly convincing %% authorities %% it could safely produce from such places . Now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for years . Similarly , a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the California coast in the early 1980s .
authority.n | 3 | Revenue doubled from two years ago . That is , if the company reported results correctly . The Asahi Shimbun , a Japanese daily , last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax %% authorities %% over a two-year period . The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment , and Mr. Kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . The small , wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world .
authority.n | 1 | `` But if you support him over rape victims , this may be your last term . '' Separately , the House last night approved a nearly $ 67 billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration 's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $ 124,875 , and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new %% authority %% to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners . By a 325-92 margin , the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back an early challenge by House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D. , Texas ) to the FHA provision . And on a closer 250-170 roll call , lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a House-Senate conference earmarking community development funds for more than 40 projects backed by often influential members .
authority.n | 3 | One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20 % of his time on insurance , he says . Other forms of red tape are more pervasive . The most onerous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record-keeping and filing required by tax %% authorities %% . Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second . But gripes run the gamut .
authority.n | 1 | One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods . Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson ( himself a recent math major at Harvard ) in the November American Spectator . -- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of %% authority %% over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline . Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head . With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
authority.n | 3 | The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out . Dozens of workers were injured , %% authorities %% said . There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
authority.n | 1 | Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity . But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue . And if Congress is going to assume %% authority %% to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too . The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega . When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads .
authority.n | 1 | The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee . Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies . However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit %% authority %% to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans . The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans .
authority.n | 3 | The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . '' The exchange was all the more remarkable in that %% authorities %% released television footage to Western news agencies . This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . ''
authority.n | 3 | This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . In making cases , the %% authorities %% frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
authority.n | 3 | As she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party leaders , including Nguyen Van Linh , then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary , kept her out of jail . Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress , Mrs. Thi has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the Vietnamese version of perestroika . The %% authorities %% have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . '' Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman . `` Some people call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors .
authority.n | 1 | But Mr. Skinner disagreed , calling the legislation `` a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry . '' In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson ( D. , Calif. ) , the secretary also said the bill `` would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources . '' Currently , the Transportation Department does n't have the %% authority %% to block a takeover in advance . However , if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate , the department may revoke its certificate , grounding the airline . Such authority is more than adequate , say opponents of the legislation .
authority.n | 1 | The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba . The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces , federal officials said . The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone companies in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative %% authority %% . Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec , Ontario , British Columbia and the Northwest Territories . The governments of Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies .
authority.n | 1 | It 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs . For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it . Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois ( the first time that a state has used its educational facilities %% authority %% to support construction of a theater ) , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets . The rest , he is confident , can be raised . His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
authority.n | 3 | Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates . For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima %% authorities %% for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period . The woman had nearly died . But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away .
authority.n | 5 | Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency . That is n't all . Last year , the Irish airport %% authority %% , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport . Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow . Duty-free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July , and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon .
avoid.v | 1 | Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by Campeau , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction . Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's . Hoping to %% avoid %% another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' says one investment banker who follows the retail industry .
avoid.v | 1 | `` The World Series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester , which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago . `` You 've got to judge where the network will be in three years . '' The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS ca n't %% avoid %% big losses on the sports coverage itself . And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc .
avoid.v | 1 | The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby . They strongly suggest that Justice 's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert , Michael Milken and Princeton\/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness . Justice is attempting to %% avoid %% a replay of these tactics . This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani , who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets . The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors , clients , bankers and others .
avoid.v | 1 | Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . But for the most part , officials have %% avoided %% expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
avoid.v | 1 | The economic loss , jobs lost , anguish , frustration and humiliation are beyond measure . And most of these are absolutely unnecessary . Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been %% avoided %% . An accountant did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . `` I guess I was naive , '' he said .
avoid.v | 1 | The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants . The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors %% avoid %% disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said . Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said . The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
avoid.v | 1 | Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to %% avoid %% an imminent public or private injury . '' Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives . In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling .

Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` The situation you want to %% avoid %% is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says . `` That 's crazy . '' His advice : Do n't panic .
avoid.v | 1 | One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to %% avoid %% nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups .
avoid.v | 1 | This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby %% avoid %% the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .
avoid.v | 1 | Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution . Their President , Jefferson Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association '' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution '' . The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation '' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully %% avoided %% mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution . They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .
avoid.v | 1 | The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots . At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to %% avoid %% striking his head on the heavy beams . In the corner was the soldier with the white flag . He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .

What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification . She realized I 'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could %% avoid %% mentioning her name . Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits . But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits .
avoid.v | 1 | She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . When there was bridge at Edythe 's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who 'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to %% avoid %% a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .

Still , `` how sweet it is , '' he says , savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall .

This contract , covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day-to-day basis . The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10 % %% base %% wage increase over the life of the three-year contract , plus bonuses of 8 % the first year and 3 % the second . On top of that , Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5 % for each year of the contract . The union , though , has called the offer `` insulting . ''

base.n | 7 | Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people . Congress sent to Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % . The measure also moves more than $ 450 million in the Pentagon budget to home-state projects from foreign %% bases %% . U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases . The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons .
base.n | 1 | The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1 % in October from the previous month and was up 3.64 % from October 1988 , the Ministry of Economic Affairs said . The index , which uses a %% base %% of 1981 as 100 , was calculated at 140.91 points in October , from 140.74 in September . Annual inflation rose to 3.64 % in October from 3.55 % in September . Belgium 's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year , but the ministry said the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August .
base.n | 7 | Congress sent to President Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % while revamping the Pentagon budget to move more than $ 450 million from foreign %% bases %% to home-state projects . The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees , and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S. 's standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable . Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany , Japan , South Korea , the United Kingdom and the Philippines , for example , are cut by almost two-thirds , while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home .
base.n | 3 | I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem . The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual %% base %% of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work . The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs . We designed a comprehensive program , and we worked hard on it .
base.n | 3 | It has more drug users than Boston has people . Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all . Its tax %% base %% is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year . This is New York City . When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
base.n | 7 | Just this week , the House-Senate conference met -- 231 conferees , divided into 26 different subconferences . Senator Daniel Inouye agreed to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $ 11 million for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital . Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $ 40 million in military %% bases %% for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $ 70 million for bases in Tennessee . President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work . He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork .
base.n | 3 | The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist . `` If you have a position , you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much , '' says Republican strategist John Sears . The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush , who , Mr. Sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological %% base %% . By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters , the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments . Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House .
base.n | 7 | But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects , ranging from a $ 11 million parking garage here , to a land transfer in Hawaii , to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state . The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest . Mr. Inouye , who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs , used his power to move $ 400,000 from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned %% base %% to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center . Meanwhile , House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $ 3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative , cutting other federal spending 0.43 % to pay for it . A formal House-Senate conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week .

base.n | 7 | In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet %% bases %% may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas . Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .

Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina , Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand . They are `` at the %% base %% of all of the problems of corruption , '' he says . Thus , in recent contract negotiations , Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks . The union also ceded the 2 % commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts .

base.n | 7 | In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates . At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces . The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime %% base %% . The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime .
base.n | 7 | But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .

Predictably , some Navy guys said : `` Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without %% bases %% and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa ?

CBS News , which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks , now hires featured actors %% beginning %% at $ 2,700 a week . That is n't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes , or even Connie Chung for that matter ( who is paid $ 1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom `` Murphy Brown '' ) .

The disarray in the junk-bond market that %% began %% last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation 's largest law firms . While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past . Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour .

Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year %% begins %% Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders . Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % .

begin.v | 1 | The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices . In the Missouri case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law . The preamble says that human life %% begins %% at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution . Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins . But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .

Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors . The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms .
begin.v | 1 | Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment . By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . '' Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly %% began %% its steady climb back to health . Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already !
begin.v | 1 | When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would %% begin %% producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
begin.v | 1 | The carriers were competing fiercely for market share . Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has %% begun %% to `` stabilize . '' Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros .

It also said the union had agreed to meet the company for further talks tomorrow . The strike at five De Beers mines %% began %% last Thursday , with 9,500 out of a total 10,000 NUM members employed on De Beers mines participating , according to the union , while De Beers said there were 7,800 participants . The union has demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage while De Beers 's final offer was an increase of 17 % . A 35-nation environmental conference opened in Sofia , Bulgaria .

Britain 's Thatcher summoned senior advisers for strategy talks as opinion polls showed the prime minister 's popularity had hit a record low following the resignation last Thursday of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawson . One poll , conducted for the British Broadcasting Corp. , found that 52 % of voters %% believed %% that she should quit .

Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer . He %% believed %% colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring . Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage .
believe.v | 1 | After years of wild swings , oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel . That is n't the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago . But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both producers and users to %% believe %% in . Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again . The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's crude .
believe.v | 1 | All of that is just for starters , or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding . Of like , though lesser , note , Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so . And , last but not least , President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and %% believes %% that Mr. Krenz `` ca n't turn the clock back '' in East Germany because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told the New York Times 's R.W. Apple Jr . ( In other words , after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences , the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing to be welcomed , rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion . ) All of this is what history will note , assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke , when the record of this time is put down .
believe.v | 1 | The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embraces the employees ' perspective . A. Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla . I %% believe %% Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others . A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management . Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .
believe.v | 1 | Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services . The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease . The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs %% believed %% effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug 's usage for adults in March 1987 .
believe.v | 1 | The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least . The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites . But John LaWare , a Fed governor , told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed 's %% believes %% the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating . For instance , he noted , the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites . Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination .
believe.v | 1 | Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo . As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem . So after 70 years , it is confessing the obvious , hoping to be %% believed %% about other things . It 's not enough . If the Soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious .

'' We do n't believe it . And we certainly do not %% believe %% that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it . Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself . The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing .

She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range . `` I %% believe %% that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ 1.20 region , '' she added . She thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well . She noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about 2.5 % to 3 % .

He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . Some auto executives %% believe %% the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels .
believe.v | 2 | But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick . He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman , a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974 . Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who %% believes %% in conducting official business in the open . Early in his political career , as a city councilman in San Antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` bat-roost meeting . '' The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision .
believe.v | 1 | January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day . December palladium was off $ 1.55 an ounce at $ 137.20 . Platinum is %% believed %% to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 . Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released today . Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters .
believe.v | 1 | Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . '' Analysts %% believe %% he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses . Prudential 's Final Four Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account .
believe.v | 1 | That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing . Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette . The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts %% believe %% is partly responsible for its staid performance . Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 . Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .

Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time %% believing %% that commercial considerations were the only reason . Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats .
believe.v | 1 | Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market . Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors . Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she %% believes %% Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said . Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals ( a role usually filled by a minicomputer ) , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
believe.v | 1 | In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . It also adds to the mystery of the venture . Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , %% believes %% that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . `` Once people got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says . He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says .
believe.v | 1 | Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . For instance , some analysts %% believe %% bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past . Portfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio .
believe.v | 1 | Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels . Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts %% believe %% the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter . The recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . `` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington .
believe.v | 1 | By and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he %% believes %% will be temporarily better price behavior . He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports .
believe.v | 1 | At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows . He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September . However , Mr. Dillow said he %% believes %% that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports . Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion . Mr. Briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3 billion current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions .
believe.v | 1 | The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa , with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress . But here in Morgenzon , a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal , the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady . The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands , a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- %% believe %% that the solution to South Africa 's racial problems is n't the abolition of apartheid , it 's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races . Here , then , is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid 's last stand . Their idea is to create a city , first , and then an entire nation -- without blacks .
believe.v | 1 | Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now %% believe %% that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said . The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal .
believe.v | 1 | He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . It is to say rather , I %% believe %% , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern . The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .
believe.v | 1 | No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic . Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy . Since the Supreme Court 's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I %% believe %% the majority would have been for the Old South . Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .
believe.v | 1 | The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They %% believe %% that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
believe.v | 1 | Helpless in that sense I can never be again . However , I confess my hope that I will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone . For innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is I %% believe %% the one most to be prayed for . Although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks . It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .
believe.v | 2 | Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must %% believe %% we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
believe.v | 2 | If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil . He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth . That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they %% believe %% in . Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge . Their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .
believe.v | 1 | This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . And yet we obviously also %% believe %% that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?
believe.v | 1 | So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend . It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln 's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union . They differed in the balance they %% believed %% essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves . The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people . But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways .
believe.v | 1 | These men are not callous . It is their job to think about the unthinkable . Unanimously they %% believe %% that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too -- thought about accidental war . The first systematic thinking about this Pandora 's box within Pandora 's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist . He was , and is , with the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force .

This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism . It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not %% believe %% it . In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine . He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright .

believe.v | 2 | For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of Charles 's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father 's bass tones rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop . But he had to follow the light . Unless God expected a man to %% believe %% the Holy Scriptures , why had He given them to him ? ? The white-clad trees stood like specters in the February night . Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St. Peter 's .
believe.v | 1 | Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not %% believe %% a word of it ) , he raised his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as usual , loved it .
believe.v | 2 | Time stood still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning . `` People never live forever '' . Her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could %% believe %% . They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all . There was no dream of escape for these people .
believe.v | 1 | She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes . Mike turned away . He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had n't meant what he had %% believed %% it had . He felt unutterably weary . Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .

There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson . Of course , males play a role there , but %% believe %% me when I say you would n't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga . Indeed , you would n't live long , for the females either drive the men they 've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods . In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' .

believe.v | 1 | She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house . Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom . On her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving -- an object which , Pamela %% believed %% now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major Hiram Munroe Culver . He had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him . If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .
believe.v | 1 | Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . As violently as possible . But he was so taken aback , he could not %% believe %% any rage of his would make her give in . On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . And if he surrendered after raving at her .

With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance . Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities .

believe.v | 2 | If it is love , you do n't . And I 'll take you with me . Even if that 's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you %% believed %% it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie . Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you . And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .
believe.v | 1 | I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor . My unscientific friend does not %% believe %% that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . A bee 's place is in the hive '' .
believe.v | 1 | Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you %% believe %% the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ? `` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him . `` Do you remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously ? ?

It is n't what the ideologist %% believes %% in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . Complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad .

bill.n | 3 | DRUG WARS : A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers ' licenses of some drug offenders . The %% bill %% would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
bill.n | 3 | Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise minimum-wage %% bill %% , opening the way for the first wage-floor boost in more than nine years . The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue . President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue .
bill.n | 5 | The average one-year savings-type CD was down to 7.99 % from 8.01 % , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service that tracks CD yields . `` This week was uneventful for the CD market , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury %% bill %% rates '' in the past two weeks . Banks that adjusted payouts on CDs in the most recent week made only fractional moves , he said . The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday .
bill.n | 5 | However , CDs sold through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board . The average six-month CD in that category added 0.05 percentage point to 8.35 % , for example . Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury %% bill %% increase . Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country , 8.33 % is the highest yield available . It is offered by the flagship banks of New York 's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only .
bill.n | 5 | Short-term rates also were mixed . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday 's auction to 7.79 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04 % . The discount rate on six-month Treasury %% bills %% fell slightly to 7.60 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99 % .

bill.n | 3 | The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart , Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas , are expected to resume today . Last night , after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House , Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill , now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee , and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments . Under this plan , two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate %% bill %% . Republicans would try to attach a capital-gains provision to that legislation , hoping the political popularity of its other two parts would dissuade Democrats from blocking it . Democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 2.3 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 16 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 13.71 billion in maturing %% bills %% . However , the Treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date . The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Feb. 8 , 1990 , and May 10 , 1990 , respectively .
bill.n | 3 | Assuming final enactment this month , the prohibition will take effect 96 days later , or in early February . On a 394-21 roll call , the House adopted the underlying transportation measure . But the %% bill %% still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ 3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs . The additional spending pushes the measure more than $ 2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling , and the House Appropriations Committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today . The separate $ 67 billion bill sent to the White House had budget difficulties , too , but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in Congress and the administration itself .
bill.n | 3 | The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion . A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits . And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the %% bill %% would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe . Separately , the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .
bill.n | 3 | `` Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue , '' says Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass . ) . `` It 's a bottom-line issue . '' Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a %% bill %% that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost-control measures . Partly in response , a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support . It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices .
bill.n | 3 | A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D. , Mass . ) says Mr. Thornburgh would be required to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed . Among other things , the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department . The Senate is expected to consider the %% bill %% shortly , says the senator 's spokesman . Mr. Runkel says he doubts Mr. Kennedy can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the Justice Department . `` We will vigorously oppose the bill , '' he says .

'' If this passes -- a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time . It also could put the government into the RU-486 business , which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector drug industry .
bill.n | 3 | Since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty . But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . The Thurmond %% bill %% would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated . Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage . The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire .
bill.n | 3 | For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed . Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death . In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond %% bill %% had been in effect in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff . The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years . `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member .

Due to the Treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight , yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales . The Treasury %% bills %% sold yesterday settle today , rather than the standard settlement day of Thursday . And because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity . Because of the early settlement , the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account .

However , analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury %% bills %% that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market .

Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people .

U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases .
bill.n | 4 | Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies . The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market . As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical %% bills %% , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them . `` Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide . `` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % .
bill.n | 3 | Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request . Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less , their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640 % and 430 % , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures . The swift passage of the %% bill %% , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs . By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration . The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
bill.n | 3 | Part of the increase would provide $ 90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten 's Mississippi . But as much as $ 177 million , or nearly 30 % of the account , is marked for potential transfers to research , management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip . The %% bill %% 's managers face criticism , too , for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent . Conservatives , embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development , have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress . HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week , but received little support from the White House budget office , which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments .
bill.n | 4 | The premium the elderly pay for coverage of doctor 's %% bills %% under Part B of the Medicare health insurance plan will rise to $ 29 a month in 1990 from $ 27.90 , the Department of Health and Human Services said . In addition , a second Part B premium to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $ 4.90 a month from $ 4 , if Congress does n't change the program . The House has voted to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 , however , which would end the monthly catastrophic-care premium , as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by about 40 % of the wealthier Medicare beneficiaries .
bill.n | 5 | The issue 's yield rose to 7.93 % from 7.88 % . Late Thursday , the Treasury said it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week . Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management %% bills %% . Instead , the Treasury announced it would sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today , as usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday . By moving the settlement date ahead , the Treasury can raise money under the $ 2.87 trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow , after which it reverts to $ 2.8 trillion .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today , raising all new cash . The %% bills %% will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 , No non-competitive tenders will be accepted . Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury also announced details of this week 's unusual bill auction , which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow . The 13-week and 27-week bills will be issued tomorrow rather than Thursday , Nov. 2 , as originally planned . The three-month bills will still mature Feb. 1 , 1990 , and the six-month %% bills %% on May 3 , 1990 . The Treasury also said noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than Sunday , Oct. 29 , and received no later than tomorrow . The Treasury said it wo n't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing Nov. 2 held in the Treasury 's book-entry system .
bill.n | 3 | The next time you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit , consider what Congress did Friday . The Senate , 84-6 , voted to increase to $ 124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the FHA , which lost $ 4.2 billion in loan defaults last year . Then , by voice vote , the Senate voted a pork-barrel %% bill %% , approved Thursday by the House , for domestic military construction . Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves : For construction in West Virginia , Mr. Bush requested $ 4.5 million ; Congress gave Senator Byrd 's state $ 21.5 million .
bill.n | 3 | Mr. Bush , former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process . They maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills . Those %% bills %% ca n't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating . Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets . More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution .
bill.n | 3 | Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare , would n't be affected . Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity . And it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending %% bills %% rather than in the official bills themselves . Still , proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important `` chilling effect '' on all manner of appropriations bills . Lawmakers , they say , would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later .
bill.n | 3 | The legislator , Enrique Garcia , had actively backed the plant , but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila . The country 's Supreme Court dismissed the suit , but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration . In addition , President Aquino has yet to sign into law a %% bill %% removing a stiff 48 % tax on naphtha , the principal raw material to be used in the cracker . However , at a news conference Thursday , Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site , adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province . `` We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them , but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province , '' Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents .
bill.n | 3 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching %% bill %% that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
bill.n | 3 | The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct . Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry . Indeed , some of the %% bill %% 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges . Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges , the industry and ultimately the general public . One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker .
bill.n | 3 | This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers . A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the %% bill %% , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
bill.n | 3 | That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the %% bill %% .
bill.n | 3 | Last week , the government took three bills to the National Assembly . The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system . Highlights of the %% bills %% , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation 's six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas . The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property . -- A tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .
bill.n | 3 | `` Read my lips , '' said Mr. Smith . `` If you 're for paying the claims ... I do n't know how anyone can oppose this . '' No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the %% bill %% commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders .

The lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments . This is the fifth year Citizens for Tax Justice has released a study on corporate tax %% bills %% . Earlier reports , which revealed that as many as 73 companies were avoiding income tax legally , have been credited with helping galvanize efforts to overhaul the tax code . But even though companies are paying more taxes , many are still paying less than the statutory rate , the report said .

bill.n | 3 | The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year , `` This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1 , 1989 . '' This means Interior contacts can not be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed . If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional %% bill %% , Rep. John Dingell is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead . President Reagan vetoed this as a First Amendment violation . The `` Fairness '' Doctrine 's enthusiasts are incumbents in the House who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts , deterring feisty challengers .
bill.n | 3 | Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder . The measure is expected to move through this Congress . But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the %% bill %% that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress . Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets . He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . ''
bill.n | 4 | At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due . The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed . Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the %% bill %% . In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . Daniel Brigham
bill.n | 5 | In Tuesday 's gyrating session , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day , but finished with less than a four-point loss . Renaissance 's last portfolio shift , carried out by Goldman , Sachs & Co. , was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills . The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when Renaissance 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and Treasury %% bills %% . At the time , the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200 . The Dow average now stands more than 20 % higher , while Renaissance 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6 % through the first three quarters of the year .
bill.n | 5 | The man who brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer , a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program , Mr. Whitford writes . Mr. Meyer 's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a $ 100 bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards . One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 %% bills %% that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's president .
bill.n | 3 | Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter . He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement . Even so , his %% bill %% is given little chance of passage . Reps. Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the Treasury secretary to the 12-member Fed committee that makes monetary policy . Instead , the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials .
bill.n | 3 | The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements . The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase . Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers , now says the %% bill %% would further disturb the jittery capital markets . Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . '' It is ironic that at a time when America 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia , so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline , Aeroflot .
bill.n | 3 | Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools . As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class woman , Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ? Or that the president would have hurried to sign the %% bill %% `` out of compassion for her plight '' ? To ask those questions is to answer them . Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government .
bill.n | 3 | The White House called on Congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction %% bill %% , but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea . Earlier this month , the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act . But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work .
bill.n | 3 | But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work . `` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction %% bill %% . Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there . Meanwhile , President Bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut .
bill.n | 3 | In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . ) Also last spring , Rep. Ron Dellums ( D. , Calif. ) , introduced a %% bill %% requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement . In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping . The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .
bill.n | 3 | `` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . '' The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill . Spiegel also opposes the beeper %% bill %% , saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors . Laura Dale , center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in Reno , Nev. , defends monitoring . `` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. Dale , who supervises 350 operators .
bill.n | 3 | Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . He says he has n't yet studied the Dellums %% bill %% , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . '' Still , Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial . A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone .
bill.n | 3 | The roll call was considered an illustration of the limits of power that the resurgent abortion-rights movement faces . The legislation was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health . Michigan 's Senate passed a %% bill %% requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania 's House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy . The FDA is expected to approve today a program granting access free of charge to the drug AZT for children with AIDS . Adults have had access to the only approved antiviral drug since 1987 .
bill.n | 3 | `` Unless he changes , they lose , '' said a Democratic leadership aide . The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . By a lopsided 97-1 margin , the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the %% bill %% on a 303-107 roll call . The package is more than $ 1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week . But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations .
bill.n | 3 | `` But if you support him over rape victims , this may be your last term . '' Separately , the House last night approved a nearly $ 67 billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration 's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $ 124,875 , and the %% bill %% gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners . By a 325-92 margin , the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back an early challenge by House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D. , Texas ) to the FHA provision . And on a closer 250-170 roll call , lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a House-Senate conference earmarking community development funds for more than 40 projects backed by often influential members .
bill.n | 4 | If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale 's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20 , manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10 . But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until March , April or even May . Some in the market question whether Campeau will be in a position to pay %% bills %% at that time . `` Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations , '' says Kurt Barnard , publisher of Barnard 's Retail Marketing Report . `` The buyers who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 1.8 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 13.81 billion in maturing bills . The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing Feb. 1 , 1990 , and May 3 , 1990 , respectively . Tenders for the %% bills %% , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches . The Treasury said it will alter the auctions unless it has assurance of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auctions Monday .
bill.n | 3 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying %% bill %% approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
bill.n | 5 | The General Accounting Office estimates that 50 % of IRS audits do n't spot companies that fail to file the reports . UH HUH : A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $ 500 to go into a bank and change $ 44,400 in small %% bills %% into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the Tax Court found . It held that Testa is taxable on $ 44,400 of unreported income . WHY BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts ? a retiree asks .
bill.n | 3 | Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians . The Diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time . So most %% bills %% are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
bill.n | 5 | FOREIGN PRIME RATES : Canada 13.50 % ; Germany 9 % ; Japan 4.875 % ; Switzerland 8.50 % ; Britain 15 % . These rate indications are n't directly comparable ; lending practices vary widely by location . TREASURY BILLS : Results of the Monday , October 23 , 1989 , auction of short-term U.S. government %% bills %% , sold at a discount from face value in units of $ 10,000 to $ 1 million : 7.52 % 13 weeks ; 7.50 % 26 weeks .

bill.n | 4 | That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . There is an element of make-work involved . Consumers pay the %% bill %% for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car . If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .
bill.n | 4 | The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed . Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says . He notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying %% bills %% rather than a handy way of borrowing . In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . '' And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. Durkin says , `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . ''

bill.n | 3 | The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said . Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible . An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the %% bill %% . '' Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . '' Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
bill.n | 3 | The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from . Consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care . The President came up with a good %% bill %% , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill . It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services . They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities .
bill.n | 4 | Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts . Lawyers will benefit . Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge %% bill %% . The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
bill.n | 4 | Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common . Two such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant . One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal %% bills %% and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz .
bill.n | 3 | `` As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself . '' We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again . A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' %% bill %% now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats . The Coats bill , which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills . Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items that just go too far .
bill.n | 3 | A House-Senate conference approved a nearly $ 17 billion State , Justice and Commerce Department %% bill %% that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1 . The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of approximately $ 1.25 billion is paid . The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments , but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988 .
bill.n | 3 | But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the %% bill %% makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency . Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger . Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C. ) , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
bill.n | 3 | The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . As part of the same %% bill %% , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor ( D. , Ark . ) calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . To be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .
bill.n | 3 | Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year . Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction %% bill %% that did n't contain a capital-gains provision . That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators . The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
bill.n | 3 | Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation . To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue . The president apparently will have only one %% bill %% to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren ( D. , Okla. ) , a leader of those Democrats . The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
bill.n | 5 | Short-term rates rose yesterday . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week %% bills %% yesterday . The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 . Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
bill.n | 5 | Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter . The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier , Donoghue 's said . At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury %% bills %% on Monday , the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % . Likewise , certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday . The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion .
bill.n | 4 | But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed . `` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. Bailit said . David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care %% bills %% by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs . Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
bill.n | 3 | On Monday , a letter from Mr. Skinner 's deputy , Elaine Chao , said the administration opposed the legislation `` in its present form . '' Some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat . The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers , especially senior Republicans who supported the %% bill %% because they thought the Transportation Department favored it . `` We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner , '' one Republican said , `` and now we 're out there dangling in the wind . '' A few weeks ago , Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be `` cleaner , more efficient '' if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance .
bill.n | 3 | The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the %% bill %% are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt . The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market . `` It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort , '' Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee , said during the panel 's deliberations .
bill.n | 4 | Just in time for Halloween , Britain 's Oxford University Press is publishing a `` Dictionary of Superstitions . '' The books 1,500 entries include stepping on cracks and knocking on wood ... . In New Zealand 's tiny township of Kaitaia , which has had direct dialing for less than a year , about 30 angry phone-company customers questioned the size of their %% bills %% . It turned out their children had been dialing a `` sex fantasy '' service in the U.S. .
bill.n | 4 | Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected . But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims . `` Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the %% bill %% to reconstruct San Francisco , '' said Charles Lieberman , chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities . A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake .
bill.n | 3 | Separately , Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit . The current debt limit expires Oct. 31 . He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction %% bill %% of all provisions that increase the budget deficit , including the House-passed capital-gains provision .
bill.n | 3 | Another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount . Since they have a lower interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility . The House version of the %% bill %% would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five . The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible . The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
bill.n | 3 | Congress sent President Bush an $ 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service %% bill %% providing $ 5.5 billion for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service 's air-interdiction program nearly a third . Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate , and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch . An estimated $ 33 million was added for university and science grants , including $ 1.5 million for Smith College .
bill.n | 3 | The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $ 1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI , which owned the hospital in Sullivan , Mo. , during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment . In a separate development , a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $ 44 billion agriculture bill . A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the %% bill %% , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides . The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 . The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .
bill.n | 3 | But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues , ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance . `` Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted , '' Speaker Thomas Foley ( D. , Wash . ) said . `` If there is any support for reducing the %% bill %% , it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form . '' Now those items will be discussed in a House-Senate conference , which could begin as soon as today , with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation . `` You 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out , '' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta ( D. , Calif . ) .
bill.n | 3 | That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations %% bills %% . ( Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . ) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
bill.n | 3 | Child care was one of the many `` extraneous '' bills pulled out of the Senate 's reconciliation bill last Friday . Others were the capital-gains cut , Section 89 repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act . All this stuff still is in the House 's 1,878-page reconciliation bill , and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished %% bills %% , just to see them die . Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they 'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills . House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise .
bill.n | 3 | The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the power to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the %% bill %% . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low . The drop , following a 6.2 % decline in August , indicates the industry is still being hurt by the Fed 's anti-inflation battle .
bill.n | 3 | Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind . ) said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D . ) are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy . Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget . The original %% bill %% was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy . Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . ''
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 14.1 billion in maturing %% bills %% . The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 , 1990 , and April 26 , 1990 , respectively . Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance . Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves . And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance %% bill %% sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass . ) despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually . There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions . The Section 89 victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals .
bill.n | 3 | Among major domestic agencies , the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ 829.9 million . An estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation , and within the Housing and Urban Development Department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families . To an unusual degree , the massive %% bill %% has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states . While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities . The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the House and Senate .
bill.n | 3 | The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities . In a sharply written letter , Rep. David Obey , chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned Mr. Bush that the result of his `` ultimatum '' could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere . `` As a result of your ultimatum , '' writes the Wisconsin Democrat , `` I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this %% bill %% .
bill.n | 3 | But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . It was the first time in 20 years that such government %% bills %% were defeated . In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power .
bill.n | 3 | Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995 . Instead , a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative . The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air %% bill %% .
bill.n | 3 | Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as socalled locals . `` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel . Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in %% bills %% to reauthorize CFTC operations . The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system . The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .
bill.n | 3 | AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass , or both . AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs . Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a %% bill %% to protect AMR executives . `` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday , '' Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress . AMR declined to comment , and Mr. Trump did n't respond to requests for interviews .
build.v | 1 | Some equipment going to work is almost new . Grace Energy just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from Caspar , Wyo. , to drill the Bilbrey well , a 15,000-foot , $ 1-million-plus natural gas well . The rig was %% built %% around 1980 , but has drilled only two wells , the last in 1982 . Until now it had sat idle . For Zel Herring , owner and a cook at the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for a very good year .
build.v | 1 | Hughes Aircraft Co. , a General Motors Corp. unit , said the Intelsat VI commercial communications satellite is set to be launched Friday .

build.v | 1 | For the real estate industry , a watchword for the 1990s will be buy , more than %% build %% . That 's the word expected to be on the lips of the more than 3,000 developers , pension-fund advisers and real estate financiers slated to attend a four-day conference , beginning here today , sponsored by the Urban Land Institute . The ULI is a non-profit research and education group based in Washington , D.C. , with 14,000 members nationwide .
build.v | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will %% build %% a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
build.v | 1 | One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way . Du Pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for CFCs . Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is %% building %% a plant in Louisiana to produce it . Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course . There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise .
build.v | 1 | Japan 's production of cars , trucks and buses in September fell 4.1 % from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association said . Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2 % fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to %% build %% vehicles overseas , according to the association . The association said domestic demand grew 8.8 % in September . Demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro-consumption government policies , an association spokesman said .
build.v | 1 | The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . Detrex is setting aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . In addition , the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with Ohio to %% build %% a $ 1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $ 48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute .

About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . The courthouse , to be %% built %% in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 . Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms .
build.v | 3 | Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason . Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to %% build %% market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs . At a news conference this week , Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
build.v | 3 | IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners . Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , the IRS has said . Once such abuses become so pervasive , the IRS %% builds %% another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them . San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because IRS agents envy their life styles . Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
build.v | 3 | With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it . But with every step I take , I 'm %% building %% wealth . You can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the bullet . So go out there and eat that debt .
build.v | 1 | They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . `` I do n't think there 's anyone not %% building %% one . '' He does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel . That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
build.v | 1 | A spokeswoman for Millicom , a telecommunications company , said she did n't know the value of the contract . Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license . Millicom said it would %% build %% and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB , part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden , and Arfeen International , Pakistan .
build.v | 1 | The Berlin Wall still stands . But the man who %% built %% it has fallen . East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker , one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world , in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens . But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc , it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon .
build.v | 2 | In addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome . Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to %% build %% up inside . Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later .
build.v | 1 | Algeria plans to increase natural-gas sales to Europe and the U.S. . According to the Middle East Economic Survey , the North African nation is holding talks with Italy for adding a fourth pipe to a section of the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline , expanding capacity by up to six billion cubic meters a year from 12.5 billion . Algeria also wants to %% build %% a pipeline through Morocco and across the Strait of Gibraltar to supply Spain , France and West Germany with up to 15 billion cubic meters a year by the late 1990s . South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers agreed to suspend the strike by diamond workers and resume negotiations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. over their wage dispute , De Beers said . It also said the union had agreed to meet the company for further talks tomorrow .
build.v | 3 | Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity . He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory . Strindberg 's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and %% build %% anew from the ground up . Heidenstam 's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past . Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam 's later work was concerned with Sweden .
build.v | 1 | The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . One wonders about its applicability to people . Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid %% built %% a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ? The answer is , of course , yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .
build.v | 1 | It was a fortunate time in which to %% build %% , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
build.v | 1 | He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing . There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same unqualified success now . He could no longer %% build %% anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values . Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality . He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday 's Herald Tribune and yesterday 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer 's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .
build.v | 3 | Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland . The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators . Globocnik %% built %% the Death's-Head Corps . Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem . As the messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin 's fountainhead spouted .

build.v | 1 | Is it not well-made ? ? Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago . It took thirty of our women almost six moons to %% build %% this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one . We are very proud of it '' . `` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .
build.v | 1 | Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis ' fortune ; ; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death . Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith . They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that %% built %% -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators . Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections . Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer .
build.v | 3 | He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables . `` What you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play . `` You ca n't %% build %% on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' . `` What are you playing '' ? ? Owen asked . `` I 'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained .
build.v | 1 | Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . `` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . He oughta be able to %% build %% a new house with all them contraptions '' . Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . `` I was just sayin ' to him that I 'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .
buy.v | 1 | Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from economists to motorists . Corporate planners can plan again . `` Management does n't want surprises , '' notes Jack Zaves , who , as fuel-services director at American Airlines , %% buys %% some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year . Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. Zaves gave up on long-term forecasts . And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds W. Henson Moore , U.S. deputy secretary of energy .
buy.v | 6 | Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale 's , which bankers in Tokyo estimate could cost between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion . Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale 's chairman , Marvin Traub , and more than half are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say . What Mr. Traub is hoping to put together , investment bankers say , is a management-led group to %% buy %% the New York department-store group that he heads from Campeau 's Federated Department Stores subsidiary . Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by Campeau , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction . Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's .
buy.v | 1 | In trading on the American Stock Exchange , Delmed closed at 50 cents , down 6.25 cents . Fresenius owns about 42 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock . The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would %% buy %% Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70 % and 80 % of Delmed 's fully diluted common stock . The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed . Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share .

'' On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion . That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay .
buy.v | 1 | THE BIG BOARD PLANS to launch its own vehicle for program trading today amid growing controversy over the practice . The new `` baskets '' of stocks will allow big investors to %% buy %% or sell all 500 S&P index stocks in a single trade . The exchange argues that the product , which the SEC temporarily approved yesterday , will help ease rather than worsen any volatility in the stock market . SEC Chairman Breeden said he would consider imposing `` circuit breakers '' to halt program trading during sharp swings in the market .
buy.v | 1 | One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market . Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign . This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically %% buying %% cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents . He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 .
buy.v | 1 | Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc.

Time officials declined to comment .
buy.v | 1 | At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help %% buy %% a 45-acre horse farm . `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your horse , '' he says . But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
buy.v | 1 | Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap , economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about # 20 billion from # 14.6 billion in 1988 . Increasingly , economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry . `` When the country gets wealthier , we tend to %% buy %% high-quality imports , '' Mr. Owen said .

They still %% buy %% apples mainly for big , red good looks -- that 's why so many taste like woodchucks ' punching bags . But freshness counts more than it once did , and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apples . `` Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis , '' says Chuck Tryon , perishables director for Super Valu Inc. , a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor .
buy.v | 1 | The government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways . When industries were weak , it protected them . It gave the Japanese people a value system , based on the rationalization that given the country 's lack of natural resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and %% buy %% food with the surplus . Individual prosperity inevitably would result . That system has worked .

buy.v | 1 | `` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group . `` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . '' Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was %% buying %% . He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch . But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks .
buy.v | 1 | `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . `` The affluent people and the corporations can %% buy %% it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .
buy.v | 6 | And most of these are absolutely unnecessary . Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided . An accountant did not review the seller 's books before %% buying %% a business . `` I guess I was naive , '' he said . There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense .
buy.v | 6 | Consumers Power Co. filed with the Michigan Public Service Commission a contract to buy power from the Palisades nuclear plant under a proposed new ownership arrangement for the plant . Consumers Power and Bechtel Power Corp. last year announced a joint venture to %% buy %% the plant , currently owned completely by the utility .
buy.v | 1 | New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 finished 1\/4 point stronger at 98 1\/2 bid , to yield 7.32 % . Traders said municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in Treasury issue prices . Also , municipal bonds lured %% buying %% because the stock market remains wobbly , traders contended . Mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders said . Among the new issues was Massachusetts 's $ 230 million of general obligation bonds .

buy.v | 1 | `` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. Brawer , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S. . `` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly { Maidenform } is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York . Although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of the day , to retain their femininity they are %% buying %% better quality , more upscale intimate apparel , '' he said . Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising . Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc .
buy.v | 1 | It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor . Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do . Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to %% buy %% a sports car , compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over , according to the Journal survey . Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car . Perhaps most striking , 35 % of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car .
buy.v | 1 | Because the Soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction . International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however . Shelley M. Zeiger , an entrepreneur from New Jersey who %% buys %% Soviet porcelain and `` matryoshka '' nesting dolls for export to the U.S. , says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items . Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project . Several medical concerns , including Pfizer Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach .
buy.v | 6 | Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to %% buy %% out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
buy.v | 1 | The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . Fund selling also picked up at that point . According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by %% buying %% contracts . This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling . Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market .
buy.v | 1 | World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts . The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound , down 0.37 cent . For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to %% buy %% between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .
buy.v | 1 | Once they are in the building , they stay . One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work . He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly %% buying %% crack . Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge . We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal , toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they 're defending .
buy.v | 6 | Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to %% buy %% itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
buy.v | 1 | But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices . To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year . Traders who had %% bought %% the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock . The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market . But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business .
buy.v | 6 | Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC 's International Signal & Control unit . The investigation , which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S. , follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a `` serious '' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary . International Signal & Control , Lancaster , Pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was %% bought %% by Ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million ( $ 670.3 million ) . Ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts , reducing its net asset value by more than half . The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger .

buy.v | 1 | The air force is to take at least 250 more . Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to %% buy %% used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale . Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .
buy.v | 6 | Groupe AG 's chairman said the Belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider . Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in %% buying %% out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock . Since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs ( $ 2.7 billion ) . The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate .

Besides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may %% buy %% furs later , he adds . Other furriers have also benefited from leathers . Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
buy.v | 1 | At least it has a little dash . Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather than pleasures . Like trying to %% buy %% life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash . Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible . But sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
buy.v | 3 | The difference is magnified by time , too . At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate . Did I %% buy %% it ? Well , not yet . I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
buy.v | 1 | AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising . He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery crop . And he nearly always %% bought %% and sold for cash . Along the way , Mr. Tharp omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years . The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator , Samuel James Baker .
buy.v | 1 | A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months . The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the %% buying %% and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity . The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade . Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
buy.v | 1 | Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . He also noted that the Japanese , who had been %% buying %% at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound .
buy.v | 3 | A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . The theory relies on three assumptions : 1 ) Voters can `` %% buy %% '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) . 3 ) Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .

GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about %% buying %% Soviet-built Tupolev 204s . Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities . Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian .
capital.n | 1 | I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect , '' he said . `` It 's the total relationship that is important . '' The total relationship , as Mr. Lee sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits , the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and %% capital %% . '' Japan 's recent political turbulence , Mr. Lee said , may mean Japan will slow market adjustments . `` They 'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from America , hurting their farmers . ''
capital.n | 1 | Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit . In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working %% capital %% through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget . Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . Instead , the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress .
capital.n | 1 | He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . `` If working %% capital %% financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
capital.n | 1 | The Aga Khan owns 10 % of Ifint 's capital , while IFI owns 23 % . As a result of the transaction , which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24 , Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control 79.18 % of IFI 's ordinary shares . Its %% capital %% will also be raised to 232.4 billion lire ( $ 172.5 million ) from the current 204.3 billion lire . IFI also has nonvoting preferred shares , which are quoted on the Milan stock exchange . The value of the two transactions was n't disclosed , but an IFI spokesman said no cash would change hands .
capital.n | 1 | These results compare with net income of $ 1.8 million , or 44 cents a share , for the corresponding period last year . This quarter 's loss includes pretax charges of $ 4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company 's troubled British subsidiary , and $ 3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory , publishing advances and pre-publication costs . The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser , assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives , including debt refinancing , raising %% capital %% , recapitalization , a merger or sale of the company . The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser . Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year .
capital.n | 1 | The Soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget yesterday that halves its huge deficit with cuts in defense spending and %% capital %% outlays while striving to improve supplies to frustrated consumers . The vote to approve was A proposal to raise prices of beer , tobacco and luxuries was rejected 338-44 .
capital.n | 1 | The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September . However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise %% capital %% , NRM said . In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change . Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
capital.n | 2 | The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons . Afghan guerrillas bombarded Kabul in a weekend assault that Western diplomats called one of the biggest offensives since the Soviet Union completed a troop withdrawal in February . The rebels also reportedly tightened a blockade on roads leading to the %% capital %% , and government forces shelled a guerrilla-held area in western Afghanistan . Lebanon 's Christian leader convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet after indications that he might dissolve Parliament in an attempt to scuttle an Arab-sponsored peace plan . Gen. Michel Aoun rejected the pact because it fails to provide a timetable for a Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon .
capital.n | 1 | It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates . Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . The price of attracting %% capital %% -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit . To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise . This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit .
capital.n | 1 | Unless the Soviet Union collapses , German reunification is likely to require Germany 's neutralization . The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on %% capital %% flows . Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan .
capital.n | 1 | Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline . A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the %% capital %% requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the `` core capital '' criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance . Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .

The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of National Aluminum 's 54.5 % stake in an aluminum smelter in Hawesville , Ky . The sale of the extrusion division is subject to audit adjustments for working %% capital %% changes through the closing . The agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to National Aluminum over the next two years , depending on the plant 's shipping levels . The extrusion unit produces bare and painted custom extrusions for building products and construction industries .
capital.n | 1 | At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $ 6 billion , an amount never thought possible in India . `` When they talk mega-issues , they 're truly talking mega , '' says S.A.

capital.n | 1 | `` I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market , '' says Mr. Patel , `` only a sagging tendency . '' Says M.J. Pherwani , chairman of the Unit Trust of India : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . '' But with growth come growing pains , and never has this been clearer on the Indian %% capital %% market than now . In the past , the government controlled the markets indirectly , through its tight grip on industry itself . Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much ; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly .

'' Kellogg is based in Battle Creek , Mich. , a city that calls itself the breakfast %% capital %% of the world . Another analyst , John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat , First Securities in Richmond , Va. , recently went to a `` sell '' recommendation on Kellogg stock , which closed Friday at $ 71.75 , down 75 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . `` I do n't think Kellogg can get back to 40 % this year , '' he said .
capital.n | 1 | And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done . And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of %% capital %% to companies . '' Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .
capital.n | 1 | Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of %% capital %% gains for inflation ? Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ? I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
capital.n | 1 | But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991 . To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created %% capital %% gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .

capital.n | 1 | Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load . The acquisition boosted Black & Decker 's ratio of debt to total %% capital %% to more than 80 % . Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1\/2 years . Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors .
capital.n | 1 | Today , Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal . Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $ 13 million each in 1985 , the last year for which figures are available . White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the Packwood-Roth %% capital %% gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. Mitchell . As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut . Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one official said .
capital.n | 1 | Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce %% capital %% , entrepreneurs say . If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
capital.n | 1 | Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting %% capital %% gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? The Republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings . This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ''
capital.n | 1 | There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says Francois Heisbourg , director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East . The designation at July 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step . In part , this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of %% capital %% while the U.S. is n't . While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems , yesterday France announced a three-year , four billion French franc ( $ 650 million ) aid plan for Poland . Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some Western European leaders , especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , remain skeptical about European political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds .
capital.n | 1 | Hartford expects to report a further pretax loss of about $ 30 million for the current quarter , as a result of the California earthquake this month , ITT added . The company also disclosed its financial operations had increased reserves for bankrupt accounts , resulting in a $ 40 million pretax charge for the third quarter . This charge was partly offset , however , by $ 19 million in pretax %% capital %% gains . ITT also said its consumer finance unit agreed in September to settle a civil suit with the California attorney general over alleged improper lending and sales practices . Anticipating this settlement , the company recorded a pretax charge of $ 24 million during the fourth quarter of 1988 .
capital.n | 1 | The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs . Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for %% capital %% spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .
capital.n | 1 | They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good . `` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group . The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in %% capital %% spending . MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. . Not everyone is worried , however .

This includes a working %% capital %% facility for Allied Stores of $ 350 million that matures March 15 , 1990 , and an $ 800 million bridge loan due April 30 , 1990 . The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments .

capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .

capital.n | 1 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for %% capital %% defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
capital.n | 1 | The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act . Largely to meet tougher new %% capital %% requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans . Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $ 1.31 trillion , the lowest since August 1988 . As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
capital.n | 1 | Those implications include : -- Privatization . Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance . Market-based pollution control may consume some %% capital %% that would otherwise purchase state industries . But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . -- Least-cost solutions .
capital.n | 1 | In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . '' But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue . Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible %% capital %% bonds for every nine common shares . Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors . `` The ( paper ) loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed John Nelson , a Lazard managing director .

capital.n | 1 | The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. %% capital %% markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : Imo Industries Inc. -- $ 150 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2001 , priced at par to yield 12 % . The issue will be sold through Morgan Stanley & Co .
capital.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and %% capital %% adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
capital.n | 1 | Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held . In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents . The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity %% capital %% . At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding .
capital.n | 1 | The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. %% capital %% markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. -- $ 475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures , due Oct. 15 , 2001 , priced at par to yield 14.75 % . The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .

Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the %% capital %% of Mogadishu . Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
capital.n | 2 | Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach . This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . It is also known as the fraud %% capital %% of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' . How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ? Clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter .
capital.n | 1 | The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's %% capital %% spending program .
capital.n | 1 | Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower %% capital %% and government spending and the lower inventory figures . Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
capital.n | 1 | `` Everything is up for grabs , '' says Theodore Groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for %% capital %% gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
capital.n | 1 | In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of %% capital %% gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . Many other tax benefits also were swept away . This year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
capital.n | 1 | The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren ( D. , Okla. ) , a leader of those Democrats . The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a %% capital %% asset held for more than one year . The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years . The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
capital.n | 1 | The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 . `` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up %% capital %% . At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
capital.n | 1 | `` We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business . '' The company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value , which stood at $ 28.55 a share on Sept. 30 , by more than $ 100 million , or about $ 4 a share . The company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by $ 3.25 a share when completed and boost its primary %% capital %% ratio to 7 % from 6.63 % . First City , which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns , said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere . With that possibility in mind , analysts said the transaction was a positive move for First City .
capital.n | 1 | Lonrho PLC of Britain is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine in an operation that has been engineered with the Paribas financial group , Societe Commerciale 's main shareholder . The announcement came as Societe Commerciale , a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries , reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ( $ 51 million ) for the first six months of this year , partly because of provisions on future losses . The rescue operation will consist of a %% capital %% boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds . Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to transfer its 30 % shareholding in Societe Commerciale to a new company which will be jointly owned with Lonrho . This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale .
capital.n | 2 | Apparently so . There are no easy choices in Cambodia , but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia . Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army , the State Department is talking again about accepting an `` interim '' coalition government in the Cambodian %% capital %% of Phnom Penh . The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk , and the Khmer Rouge . The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power .
capital.n | 2 | Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's %% capital %% of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
capital.n | 1 | Timothy Vincent , Petco chief executive officer , confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business . `` The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business , and after Monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more , '' he said . He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry %% capital %% requirements during the market 's rapid plunge Friday and Monday 's rebound . A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco . Over the weekend Fossett Corp. , another options trading firm , transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday 's market slide .
capital.n | 1 | Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin . In theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same . But of course the market could decide that the firm 's %% capital %% stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits . This is indeed what the market decided . By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents .
capital.n | 1 | Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average . The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund , with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75 % . That included %% capital %% gains that were passed along to customers . Among the other high-yielding funds , Fidelity 's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33 % in the latest week . The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51 % .
capital.n | 1 | Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month . Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign %% capital %% , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .
capital.n | 1 | There are about $ 25.6 million of 7.2 % term bonds due 2009 , priced to yield 7.25 % , and about $ 66.8 million of 7.2 % term bonds due 2019 , priced at 99 to yield 7.282 % . The bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody 's and S&P . Connecticut -- $ 100.4 million of general obligation %% capital %% appreciation bonds , College Savings Plan , 1989 Series B , priced by a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group . The zero-coupon bonds were priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 . The bonds have received a rating of double-A-1 from Moody 's , and a double-A-plus rating is expected from S&P , the underwriter said .
capital.n | 1 | The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value . Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's %% capital %% stock ? The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion . The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .
capital.n | 1 | Sen. Bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run . It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 , he thinks , when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets . That is , with %% capital %% gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates . The counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy . In this atmosphere , there would be no serious consideration of tax increases .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .
capital.n | 1 | Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall . At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF 's %% capital %% base . While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ 12 billion or more implicit in the IMF 's request for a doubling of its $ 90 billion capital , the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase . This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention , and with its financial commitment to Mexico , Poland and others .
capital.n | 1 | At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital . First , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility . Second , the World Bank 's recent $ 75 billion %% capital %% increase -- $ 14 billion from the U.S. -- has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions . Third , the IMF would like to meet Japan 's request for increased ownership ( currently 4.5 % ) . Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues , and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries .
capital.n | 1 | A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase , or limit it to 25 % , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly . Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets . Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any %% capital %% increase , a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged . Furthermore , a U.S. rejection of the capital increase ( and transfer of shares to Japan ) would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing . On the other hand , a decision to increase the IMF 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries .
capital.n | 1 | Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline . The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose . If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's %% capital %% , then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative . Mr. Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | Industrial production declined 0.1 % in September , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend . The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter . `` %% Capital %% spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said Robert Dederick , economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates . `` They need to do something about this , '' said Maury Harris , economist at PaineWebber Group Inc .
capital.n | 1 | The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout . Fossett still had several million dollars in %% capital %% left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said . Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .
capital.n | 1 | `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer . `` Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . '' However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary %% capital %% and pay back the resulting debt . In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . `` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain .

care.v | 1 | Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards , one for each school . This of course led to disaster in New York City . Getting a community of parents to %% care %% again about its schools is essential , but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them . The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems . The schools ' central mission , educating children , became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats , politicians and unions .
care.v | 1 | `` It 's part of our style , too . '' According to several ad-agency sources , newcomers to the Texas banking market are spending a combined $ 50 million this year to woo Texans . Meanwhile , surviving Texas banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who truly %% care %% about the state . The most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the Independent Bankers Association of Texas , although it 's hard to tell from previews of the $ 5 million `` The I 's of Texas '' TV campaign . Commercials will highlight heart-rending scenes of Texas and chest-swelling , ain't-it-great-to-be-a-Texan music .

Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised . In the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to %% care %% ; ; virtue is its own and only reward . A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories , Dashiell Hammett 's The Maltese Falcon . Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; ; but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .

I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling . Oh he 'd not %% care %% about the Pedersen kid . He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain .

care.v | 1 | All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches . When Alexander Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent . `` I do not %% care %% if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .

He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .

carrier.n | 6 | An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $ 100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization . Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal . It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the %% carrier %% 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air . All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan . ''

He added : `` How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ? '' Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic %% carriers %% , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 . Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary . Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions .

Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine , the seed producer in Scott , Miss. , said Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops . That 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves insects as %% carriers %% in crops such as cotton . `` It 's one thing to say you can sterilize , and another to then successfully pollinate the plant , '' he said . Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton .
carrier.n | 4 | Baker 's remarks came as the White House urged both sides to honor the truce . The USS Lexington returned to dock in Pensacola , Fla. , following an accident Sunday in which the pilot of a training jet crashed into the ship , killing five sailors . The captain of the aircraft %% carrier %% , the oldest in the Navy , said the flier was making his first attempt to land on a carrier . Four people torched three U.S. flags on the central steps of the U.S. Capitol in a bid to test a new federal law protecting the American flag from desecration . All four demonstrators were arrested .
carrier.n | 6 | He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating . `` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said . Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the %% carrier %% to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size . Eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its South American routes , which were valued at $ 400 million . Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid , and the two sides had to begin negotiating again .

The additions solidify American 's position as the third-largest U.S. transatlantic %% carrier %% , behind PanAm Corp. 's Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines .
carrier.n | 6 | The European Community Commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between France 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds . Meeting in Strasbourg Wednesday , the commission voted , as expected , to formally object to the accord between Air France , the state-owned airline , and state-controlled domestic %% carrier %% Air Inter . An EC spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with Brussels on how to modify the pact . At issue is an accord dating back to March in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France .
carrier.n | 6 | `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % . Delta has benefited more than other %% carriers %% from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub . Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter . Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
carrier.n | 6 | Rising operating expenses are another problem . Fuel costs were up 10 % in the third quarter . Labor costs , which leveled off in the past few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees , are on the upswing again at many %% carriers %% . And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches : USAir , for example , blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month . `` We can not quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo , '' said Edwin Colodny , chairman and president of USAir Group .
carrier.n | 6 | And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions . Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the %% carrier %% 's chief executive officer . `` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said . `` There is no difference of opinion between ( Chairman ) Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy .
carrier.n | 6 | For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending . The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong %% carrier %% , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year . Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead . Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
carrier.n | 6 | There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal . Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other %% carriers %% -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
carrier.n | 6 | `` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's . I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . '' In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. %% carrier %% . `` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says . `` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
carrier.n | 4 | In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century . The air force is to take at least 250 more . Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect %% carriers %% from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale .
carrier.n | 6 | But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions . One of the best deals , though , may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives . This week , many %% carriers %% are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas . In recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares . That approach flopped : Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh .
carrier.n | 6 | Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . The %% carrier %% has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
carrier.n | 6 | `` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Less-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April . The %% carriers %% were competing fiercely for market share . Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . ''
carrier.n | 8 | Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit . Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % , noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit . Revenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance %% carrier %% business and diversified division . Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to $ 618.9 million from $ 599.4 million a year ago . New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
carrier.n | 6 | Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management . British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British %% carrier %% . The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week . UAL stock dropped $ 1.625 yesterday to $ 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
carrier.n | 6 | But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs . Under the committee bill , the Transportation secretary would have 30 days , and an additional 20 days if needed , to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock . The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the %% carrier %% 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
carrier.n | 6 | With airline deals in a tailspin , legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group , traders say . Only a week ago , when airline buy-out fever was already winding down , Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir . He was threatening to take over the %% carrier %% , after spending an estimated $ 167 million to build an 8.4 % USAir stake for his investment clients . The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat , which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for USAir , or for his own stake . In fighting USAir , Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor , billionnaire Warren Buffett , who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt .
carrier.n | 6 | If USAir stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out , says Timothy Pettee , a Merrill Lynch analyst . But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt , he adds . In 1987 , USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the %% carrier %% . Mr. Icahn , a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt , eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear , Stearns . Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route .
carrier.n | 6 | Last month , the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations . British Airways said it has n't received a proposal from JAL . But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan , a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. %% carrier %% .

Bank of New England plans to sell some operations and lay off 4 % of its work force after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems . Eastern Airlines ' creditors have begun exploring alternative approaches to a Chapter 11 reorganization because they are unhappy with the %% carrier %% 's latest proposal . Tele-Communications agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks from Viacom for $ 225 million . The move could pose a new challenge to Time Warner 's Home Box Office .
carrier.n | 6 | Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 . Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern . He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the %% carrier %% 's old volume of 1,050 a day .
carrier.n | 4 | He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean . Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy . They had fun moving the %% carriers %% around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ?

Formed in August , the venture weds AT&T 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express 's Omaha , Neb. , service center . Other long-distance %% carriers %% have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool . Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television . The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years .
cause.v | 1 | But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't %% cause %% cancer by themselves . In recent months , researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent .
cause.v | 1 | Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes . But the ice-core samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. Thompson acknowledged . According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely %% caused %% by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space . Skeptics say that if that 's the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide . Instead , the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s , decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s , then higher temperatures again through last year .

The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could %% cause %% a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .

Two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge .

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did %% cause %% a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business . But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners ( IAFP ) , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well .

chance.n | 4 | The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending . The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion . `` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a %% chance %% , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president . Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories . But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
chance.n | 1 | Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason . Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the %% chance %% to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs . At a news conference this week , Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
chance.n | 1 | Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a %% chance %% . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
chance.n | 1 | The Coats bill , which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills . Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items that just go too far . Under the proposal , a President would have a %% chance %% twice each year to return a package of `` rescissions '' to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes . Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 % majority , but then a President could veto that rejection . Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto .
chance.n | 1 | When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the %% chance %% . Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
chance.n | 1 | The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers . But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those %% chances %% away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp . For more than a decade , banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds . Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc .
chance.n | 4 | Among the insurance stocks , big gainers included American International Group , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 ; General Re Corp. , up $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 ; Aetna , up $ 2.375 to $ 59.50 ; and Marsh & McLennan Inc. , up $ 3.125 to $ 75.875 . Still , a few individual companies , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated . `` I think there is a damned good %% chance %% someone is going to hit the skids on this , '' said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult . He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo . British , West German , Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
chance.n | 4 | Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way . I doubt that . Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments , the contingency plans in place , and Mr. Bork 's paper trail of vulnerable writings , it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much %% chance %% of being confirmed . As Mr. Bronner himself says , the smell of `` raw meat '' was in the air . Perhaps because they won , Mr. Bork 's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders .
chance.n | 4 | Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony . `` It 's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station . You might find something , but the %% chances %% are low , '' said Michael Ellman , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co . And Eugene Glazer , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a ( prediction ) of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , infringed on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass .
chance.n | 1 | Diane Seaman , an NBC-TV vice president , says NBC has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time . She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates . `` We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a %% chance %% to do couponing , '' says Ms. Seaman . `` And we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new . '' Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ''
claim.v | 1 | Quickview Systems Inc. said it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc. , %% claiming %% patent infringement in an element of Apple 's popular HyperCard software program . The suit , filed in Minneapolis federal court , claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display `` only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field . '' The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold .
claim.v | 1 | And in the past , Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations . But opponents , led by the CWA , say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented by unions . The CWA %% claims %% that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress . `` Nine to Five , '' a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill , six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses . Meanwhile , supporters of the Dellums two-party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the one-party consent law .
claim.v | 2 | Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value %% claimed %% by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid . Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge . A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
claim.v | 1 | Two Japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills AIDS-infected cells while preserving healthy cells . If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , %% claims %% only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
claim.v | 1 | `` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles . Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds . Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel %% claimed %% , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . '' Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found . During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
claim.v | 1 | Max Gitter , another GAF defense attorney , said yesterday , `` As we go in for the third time , Yogi Berra 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again . ' '' DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal . Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who %% claim %% injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co. , which manufactured the device . The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other . Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan .
claim.v | 1 | But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined . Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability . It %% claims %% the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far . The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller ( D. , Calif. ) , a sponsor of the bill .
claim.v | 1 | Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns . But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention . In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers %% claiming %% that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination . Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .
claim.v | 1 | The list of laboratories %% claiming %% to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing . But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
claim.v | 2 | Christian legislators are insisting on a Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon before agreeing to political changes giving the nation 's Moslems a greater role in Beirut 's government . Colombia 's judges launched a 72-hour strike to press security demands following Tuesday 's murder of a High Court justice in Medellin . The country 's narcotics traffickers %% claimed %% responsibility for the slaying . Most of the country 's 20,000 judges and judicial employees joined the work stoppage .
claim.v | 1 | You know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General . In his own words , Bang-Jensen ' took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public . He %% claimed %% that the release of the preliminary findings was ' prejudicial to his position ' '' . Gross bristled . For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .
claim.v | 1 | `` Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of England '' ? ? Was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich . I was chairman , the only not youthful participant . Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I %% claimed %% that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry . I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly . `` It is easy for you to talk '' ; ; countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world .
claim.v | 1 | Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately %% claiming %% every unsolved murder in the state . It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man .
come.v | 11 | Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it . There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it . The case of Rosa Parks , the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus , %% comes %% to mind as an illustration . But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign . The public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience .
come.v | 3 | The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves . In recent months , researchers have %% come %% to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
come.v | 2 | But Mr. Ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him , effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on NBC-TV 's `` Meet the Press '' that Mr. Ortega 's threat was `` a very unwise move , particularly the timing of it . '' The threat %% came %% during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America 's progress toward democracy in the region , attended by President Bush , Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders . Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night . Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army .
come.v | 1 | It 's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment , a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression . The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news . It is the New Journalism %% come %% to television . Ms. Chung 's program is just one of several network shows ( and many more in syndication ) that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events , using actors who are supposed to resemble real people , living and dead . Ms. Chung 's , however , is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors .
come.v | 11 | About the same time , the Iran-Iraq war , which was roiling oil markets , ended . In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing . It is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day , or up to 2 % annually , for years to %% come %% . For OPEC , that 's ideal . The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer .
come.v | 1 | Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up . Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives , including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked to see the future . Even the Soviet Union %% came %% , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model . Here 's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw . New Technology
come.v | 11 | Yet his co-defendant in the case -- also a former military officer by the name of Oliver North -- has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in the affair . What accounts for the difference ? During the televised Iran-Contra hearings , Mr. North %% came %% off as a patriot from central casting . Mr. Secord 's performance was decidedly less inspiring . Mr. North remains in heavy demand as a speaker , for fees reported in the $ 20,000 range .
come.v | 1 | A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc . J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` %% come %% in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' And the winners will be the colleges , not either network . Nor , by the way , advertisers . ''
come.v | 11 | `` The market acted better , but it was n't a tremendous comeback , '' Mr. Zipper observed . `` If we get a decent rally { today } , maybe the buyers will come back . '' If E.E. `` Buzzy '' Geduld is right , a seatbelt may %% come %% in handy during the next few sessions . The president of Herzog , Heine , Mr. Geduld expects the market to be `` very choppy '' for a while . `` There 's a lot of uncertainty out there , and it will cause a lot of swings , '' he said .
come.v | 9 | The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that %% came %% to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
come.v | 5 | London 's Financial Times 100-share index shed 40.4 points to finish at 2149.3 . At London 's close , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 51.23 points lower at 2611.68 . Dealers said the initial pressure %% came %% from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year . The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said . The 30-share index fell 33.3 points to 1739.3 .
come.v | 4 | Compliance added 15 % to 20 % to her accounting bill last year , she says . SALES TAX RECORDS : Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption %% comes %% at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews . To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense . `` You need one person to just take care of sales tax , '' says Jennie Tong , executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc. , New York .
come.v | 1 | Going to the well of the chamber , Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted . His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead . `` We do not %% come %% to this House asking for any handout , '' said the California Democrat . `` We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people . '' The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for low-interest disaster loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
come.v | 6 | The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw : row upon row of greenhouses , stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners ' wealth . Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken . Grain , milk and meat %% come %% next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast . Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .
come.v | 5 | `` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says Jack Rodman , managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm . But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy . The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has %% come %% from larger companies than initially anticipated , says Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner . And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time . Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
come.v | 5 | `` Nothing is too good for our golf course , '' says Tony George , a mining engineer . Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month 's elections freeing the country from South African control , De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine 's productive life for another 25 years , from the current estimate of 10 . Huge machines that look as though they %% came %% from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes . Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters ; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening plants , criss-cross the beach . Then there is the artifical sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean .
come.v | 3 | But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control . A revolution takes more than conference manifestos . Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be %% coming %% to an end . The Russians are talking peace . The Palestinians are talking elections .
come.v | 2 | Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . The tip-off %% came %% when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
come.v | 8 | In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I %% come %% across countervailing opinions quite frequently . But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in . We ca n't afford to wait . ''
come.v | 2 | That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts say they think durable goods orders fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , %% coming %% after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout . Overall , he said , the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens .
come.v | 5 | Dedication runs high . Wafaa El-Sadr , who heads the AIDS program at New York City 's Harlem Hospital Center , ca n't find help . `` I 've been recruiting every single day since it 's been identified that many AIDS patients %% come %% from the inner city , '' she says . She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time . Part of the problem , though , may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor .
come.v | 4 | `` If the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers %% came %% out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''
come.v | 2 | The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business . While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium . `` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to %% come %% along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming . He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs . Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
come.v | 1 | It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people %% came %% through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says .
come.v | 1 | The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law . Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise . The RICO law has %% come %% under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said .
come.v | 1 | The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong . Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected . Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to %% come %% . `` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co . `` Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9 % -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . ''
come.v | 5 | This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling . Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market . Such support usually %% comes %% from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York . `` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said . Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ 1.19 to $ 1.34 .
come.v | 9 | The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second . Both of Dr. Baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution . It %% came %% to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment . They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore . Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere .
come.v | 6 | Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . All of this %% comes %% ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in November . So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for Refcorp 's initial bond offering . Roger Early , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention .

Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to %% come %% in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
come.v | 2 | For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending . The first signs of trouble %% came %% last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year . Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead . Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
come.v | 5 | The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts . Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must %% come %% from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget . That would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters . Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
come.v | 8 | The disabled-workers bill ( quack , quack ) . The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did : It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child care . It %% comes %% up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal . The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from . Consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care .
come.v | 1 | He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , %% came %% on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
come.v | 5 | The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll . Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class . In addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will %% come %% from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category . But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay . This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
come.v | 2 | Parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford . Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds . That way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time %% comes %% to pay tuition . Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages . He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
come.v | 11 | This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it %% comes %% to returning money at maturity . But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . Risk is also a function of time .
come.v | 5 | Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
come.v | 5 | One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells . A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported Turgut M. Gur , an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins , head of the Stanford experimental team . One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion %% came %% from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University . Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water . He said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
come.v | 3 | Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business . Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture . Noranda and Trelleborg each %% came %% close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf . Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .

HOT TOPIC : Interest in the abortion issue is so great that the Hotline , a daily , computer-distributed political newsletter , %% comes %% up with a spinoff product called the Abortion Report dealing solely with its political implications . CONSERVATIVES EXPECT Bush to solidify their majority on a key court . Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees .
come.v | 2 | Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war . The talks %% came %% as Lebanese negotiations on political changes appeared deadlocked . GOP Sen. Specter of Pennsylvania said he would vote to acquit federal Judge Alcee Hastings in his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and bribery conspiracy . Specter , the vice chairman of the Senate 's evidence panel , said there was `` insufficient evidence to convict '' the Miami jurist .
come.v | 2 | In fact , the two men have had strikingly similar career paths , both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position . Moreover , both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy . Notably , one of Mr. Krenz 's few official visits overseas %% came %% a few months ago , when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing . He later defended the Chinese government 's response during a separate visit to West Germany . East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz , in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church .
come.v | 2 | There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve . It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey , a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO . The resolution also %% comes %% at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community . Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people ?
come.v | 3 | Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't %% come %% to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said . The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal . TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback .
come.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost %% came %% to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
come.v | 6 | Major injuries were n't reported at Candlestick Park , where the third game of baseball 's World Series was canceled and fans evacuated from the stadium . Bush vowed to veto a bill allowing federal financing for abortions in cases of rape and incest , saying tax dollars should n't be used to `` compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life . '' His pledge , in a letter to Democratic Sen. Byrd , %% came %% ahead of an expected Senate vote on spending legislation containing the provision . East Germany 's Politburo met amid speculation that the ruling body would oust hard-line leader Honecker , whose rule has been challenged by mass emigration and calls for democratic freedoms . Meanwhile , about 125 refugees flew to Duesseldorf , West Germany , from Warsaw , the first airlift in East Germany 's refugee exodus .
complain.v | 1 | At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe . Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted . So far , no ally has %% complained %% openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined .
complain.v | 1 | If the law leaves loopholes , use them . If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . And if you are caught or if people %% complain %% , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out . As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . )
complain.v | 1 | But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars . Critics have %% complained %% that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains . In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . '' The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
complain.v | 1 | Parts of the Houston Ship Channel were closed . The White House said Bush is conferring with leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to ease differences over guidelines for CIA agents . The statement came after officials said Bush %% complained %% at a private meeting last week that a strict interpretation of a policy requires the U.S. to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plots . Lebanon 's Gen. Aoun placed Christian military forces on alert in case of renewed fighting with Syrian-backed Moslems after Lebanon 's two main Shiite militias rejected an Arab-sponsored peace accord . The plan , approved by lawmakers and rejected Sunday by Aoun , includes political changes aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war .
complain.v | 1 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president %% complained %% about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
complain.v | 1 | The biggest loss , of course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society . But let us not %% complain %% of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society . But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .
complain.v | 1 | The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he %% complained %% , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean .

complete.v | 1 | Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government %% completed %% a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members . Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines . The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .

That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage . Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been %% completed %% . Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years .

His next major work , %% completed %% in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .

He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
condition.n | 1 | Since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market , at least two other junk issuers have said they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings , and several issues have been postponed . William Carmichael , Beatrice chief financial officer , said favorable market conditions in September prompted the company to plan more debt than necessary . `` However , given the changes in the market %% conditions %% that have occurred since then , we decided to sell only the amount needed to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization , '' he said . Under the firm 's original bank credit agreement , it was required to raise $ 250 million of subordinated debt to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem $ 526.3 million of increasing rate debentures in August . A month ago , when Beatrice first filed to sell debt , the company had planned to offer $ 200 million of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3\/4 % .

Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings . But he said that even under those %% conditions %% , the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger . `` The fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , '' he said .

But we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term . ''
condition.n | 1 | Conversely , strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate . Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong 's economic rhythm . Once external %% conditions %% , such as U.S. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual . But economic arguments , however solid , wo n't necessarily impress Hong Kong 's 5.7 million people . Many are refugees , having fled China 's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949 .
condition.n | 1 | Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush 's residence . For years , we tried to ignore the problem of poverty , and now that it has gotten out of hand it 's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress . Nobody should have to live in such poor %% conditions %% as in `` Sugar Ditch , '' but when you travel to Washington , Boston , Chicago or New York , the same problems exist . The only difference is , in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room , with rusty pipes called plumbing , rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers . Many middle-class people would love free food , Medicaid insurance , utilities and rent .

Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities . Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market %% conditions %% turn sour . If that proves true , analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992 , when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers . With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor .

As the market tumbled , disorderly market %% conditions %% prevailed : The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether . These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages : Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures . The situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope .
condition.n | 1 | The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute . After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital . But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial %% condition %% , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn . People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine . Then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from Finland 's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen .

Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations . Workers and management , Mr. Tyszkiewicz said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local %% conditions %% and traditions .

He predicted the debt will be reduced by another A$ 3.8 billion this fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , but did n't explain how this will be achieved . Mr. Bond blamed rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of Bell Group `` with its very high levels of shortterm debt '' for producing a %% condition %% `` that was no longer sustainable . `` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders , '' Mr. Bond said , `` we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group .

condition.n | 1 | Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts . The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective . A Carbide spokesman said `` the %% conditions %% are right for the increase to hold . '' For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense . Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
condition.n | 1 | The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away . Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise . The injured , including three in critical %% condition %% , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said . The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts . The number working at the time of the blast was n't known .
condition.n | 2 | The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 . Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories . The %% conditions %% include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale . The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book . The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 .
condition.n | 1 | Dow Chemical Co. said its Destec Energy Inc. unit has agreed to buy PSE Inc. , a Houston energy company , in a deal valued at about $ 115 million . Dow , of Midland , Mich. , said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $ 12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding . Among other %% conditions %% , the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 2\/3 % of the PSE shares outstanding , the companies said in a joint statement Friday . PSE has about 9.2 million shares outstanding . The company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding .
condition.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary %% conditions %% . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
condition.n | 2 | MARK RESOURCES INC. , Calgary , Alberta , said it agreed to sell 75 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 63.9 million ) of 8 % convertible debentures to a group of securities dealers . Mark , an oil and gas concern , said the 15-year debentures are convertible before maturity at C$ 12.50 for each Mark common share , and can be redeemed at the company 's option , under certain %% conditions %% , after Nov. 30 , 1992 .
condition.n | 1 | Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported . Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy . One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on %% condition %% that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies . Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory . He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
condition.n | 1 | Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction . Last week , the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock . Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market %% conditions %% . `` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and { Chicago & North Western } is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp . Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .

Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research , Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth . It cited cyclical %% conditions %% in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units . For the nine months , net income rose 19 % to $ 449 million , or $ 2.40 a share , from $ 375.9 million , or $ 2.01 a share , a year earlier . Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of $ 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International .

Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader , Pol Pot , has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border . So it 's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept %% conditions %% that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh . True , Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition , at least for this week . But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years , and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia .
condition.n | 1 | Mr. Krenz , 52 , was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin . Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday . ( Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical %% condition %% has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media . ) ADN said Mr. Honecker , a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military . Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week .

ANACOMP INC. , Indianapolis , NYSE , said its Xidex Corp. unit , a Sunnyvale maker of computer disks and microfilm with annual sales of $ 637 million , had only minor damage and is fully operational . ANTHEM ELECTRONICS INC. , San Jose , distributor of electronic parts , annual sales of about $ 300 million , NYSE , sustained very little damage , anticipated being `` in 100 % operating %% condition %% '' by midday .

Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market , in private transactions or otherwise , depending on market %% conditions %% and other factors .
condition.n | 1 | The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago . The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal %% conditions %% , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held . For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market .
condition.n | 1 | In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish they could . As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline , the unsettled %% conditions %% will frighten many investors . `` The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , '' says Henry Linsert Jr. , chairman of Martek Corp. , a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock . `` The more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain .

contribute.v | 2 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has %% contributed %% to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
contribute.v | 2 | The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well . Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988 . Because finance and services %% contribute %% 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year . The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes . I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
contribute.v | 2 | Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have %% contributed %% to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .

contribute.v | 2 | The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee . The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday . Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends %% contribute %% to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort .
contribute.v | 1 | As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the Contras , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington . For instance , he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party . But just one month later , he also %% contributed %% $ 100,000 to a Contra leader , according to documents released for Oliver North 's criminal trial in Washington , D.C . Yet , his political setbacks mounted . Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges .

Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not %% contribute %% to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .

defense.n | 5 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own %% defenses %% against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
defense.n | 5 | The company said Carol Cable , based in Pawtucket , R.I. , is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor , retail and original equipment manufacturer markets . Carol Cable , which operates 12 manufacturing plants , had operating profit of $ 11.7 million on sales of $ 153.3 million for the first six months of this year and operating profit of $ 25.6 million on sales of $ 294.6 million for all of 1988 . The maker of telecommunications and %% defense %% equipment said Carol Cable 's portfolio and market focus would complement the company 's current wire and cable businesses . The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of Carol Cable by Penn Central , a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals .
defense.n | 1 | In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment . But last February , a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense . The appeals court said the %% defense %% is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision . General Dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely . General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
defense.n | 7 | The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the %% defense %% and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. and the bank group Credit Lyonnais . The ministry said the swap , details of which were disclosed last Thursday , will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France 's state-sector concerns . The approval also ends any hope that Banque Nationale de Paris , another state-sector bank , might have had about taking Credit Lyonnais 's place in the accord .

defense.n | 2 | This wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures . As it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces . These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper , and each year , their end product -- the Five Year %% Defense %% Plan -- promptly melts away . The graph on the left shows how this happens ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30 , 1989 ) . Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations .
defense.n | 2 | Step 1 cleans up our books . Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion . Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year %% Defense %% Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan 's final budget submission to Congress . That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion . To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion .
defense.n | 7 | The reductions should be complete by the end of the year , a spokesman said , adding that the exact number to be cut has n't been determined . Lockheed reported a $ 32 million third-quarter net loss , largely because of cost overruns on fixed-price military contracts . Noting that other %% defense %% contractors are complaining of losses on such contracts , analysts say taxpayers have been getting illusionary bargains on weapons systems in recent years . Defense contractors `` can not continue to get contracts on that basis , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York . `` The pain is too great .
defense.n | 4 | According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made . Still , criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees . They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best %% defense %% lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid .
defense.n | 2 | At a news conference , Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice . The chairman said his board members , including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte 's capital . Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own %% defense %% or doing anything besides managing current company business . But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte , which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday . At the same time , he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas 's bid .
defense.n | 1 | `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week 's interview . He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position . But there is no %% defense %% at all for the ethos of the 1980s . We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989 : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
defense.n | 8 | Baker offered to review Israel 's `` suggested changes '' to his proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks . But the secretary of state advised Israel that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at Mideast peace . NATO %% defense %% ministers said the 16-nation alliance continues to need a strong nuclear strategy despite political changes in Eastern Europe . The ministers , concluding a two-day meeting in southern Portugal , welcomed Moscow 's pledges to cut its military forces , but urged the Soviets to do more to slash short-range nuclear weapons . The Justice Department indicated a possible challenge to a court order allowing former National Security Adviser Poindexter to subpoena ex-President Reagan 's personal papers for use in the defense case against Iran-Contra charges .
defense.n | 4 | To take advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said , Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases . Although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort . It included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs ' lawyers and %% defense %% attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .
defense.n | 7 | In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices . The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future %% defense %% contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
defense.n | 5 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital %% defense %% goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
defense.n | 5 | A piece down , the computer resigned . Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two . With the advantage of playing white ( which moves first ) , Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's %% defense %% , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted . As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight . This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development .
defense.n | 4 | In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg . The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury . The %% defense %% also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War . A more blue-collar panel became a second aim . Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
defense.n | 4 | More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish . By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the %% defense %% lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries . The ploy worked . The defense won .
defense.n | 4 | During the balloting , 26 members of the 500-seat Parliament voted against Krenz , a move considered unprecedented in the country 's 40-year history . Officials in East Berlin , responding to complaints from opposition groups , admitted police used excessive force in dispersing protesters this month . The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the %% defense %% . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake .
defense.n | 4 | The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law . Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise . The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and %% defense %% lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said .
defense.n | 4 | For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count . Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , %% defense %% attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended . There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman . Neither testified at the previous trials .
defense.n | 1 | Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a %% defense %% that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . '' Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives . In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling .

defense.n | 7 | Shareholders of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b . H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17 . The owners of the %% defense %% and aerospace concern , which include three regional states , several industrial companies and banks , met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction , in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of But agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region . The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern .
defense.n | 4 | Mr. Belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage . Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse . %% Defense %% lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually . `` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says Ignazio J. Ruvolo , a construction law specialist at Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon , a San Francisco law firm . Plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .

defense.n | 7 | Nine-month net fell 9.5 % to $ 323.4 million , or $ 1.36 a share , from $ 357.2 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier . Revenue dropped 5.4 % to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.68 billion . This year 's nine-month results include gains of $ 13 million , or five cents a share , from the sale of Schlumberger 's %% defense %% systems business , and $ 22 million , or nine cents a share , from an award by the IranU.S . Claims Tribunal . The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $ 35 million , or 13 cents a share , from sale of the company 's Electricity Control & Transformers division .
defense.n | 7 | The market for electrochemicals include the paper , water-purification and textile industries . The chemical segment had a $ 6 million gain on the sale of ammonia and urea businesses , which was offset by a $ 6 million charge for future environmental expenditures . Profit in Olin 's %% defense %% and ammunition segment rose to $ 8 million from $ 7 million . The metals segment , hurt by a strike , had break-even results , against $ 3 million a year ago . In the first nine months , net rose 21 % to $ 93 million , or $ 4.52 a share , from $ 77 million , or $ 3.62 a share a year ago .
defense.n | 7 | Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88 % , and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50 % rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin . The French electronics and %% defense %% group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ( $ 38.4 million ) , compared with 130 million francs ( $ 20.5 million ) in the corresponding period of Operating profit climbed 51 % , to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988 . Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group 's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier .
defense.n | 7 | The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs . Sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ 1.79 billion , from $ 1.65 billion , with all three major product groups reporting gains . The company said aerospace and %% defense %% sales were up 2 % for the quarter to $ 802 million , and operating profit climbed 6 % to $ 61 million , mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts . Automotive sales jumped 16 % to $ 791 million , mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems , TRW said . The group had an operating profit of $ 65 million , against a loss of $ 13 million a year earlier .
describe.v | 1 | For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses . Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a Farmers spokesman said . Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which he %% described %% as `` peanuts .
describe.v | 1 | It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy . I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher . They could all fairly be %% described %% as `` pap '' courses . But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment . I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
describe.v | 1 | At the core of Mr. Loggia 's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence . He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment . '' He %% describes %% a drowned corpse as `` Esther Williams . '' And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . '' Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the American Way .
describe.v | 1 | Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold . Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year . But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson %% describes %% as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . '' Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .
describe.v | 1 | Five countries announced they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called the `` made in Switzerland '' solution . In fact , they seemed a mite resentful . The director of Zimbabwe 's Wildlife Department %% described %% American conservationists as `` fat little puppies from urban environments who do n't know a thing about Africa . '' That 's not fair ; they 're not all fat .
describe.v | 1 | This is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction . Incidentally , there was an Atlas firing last night . From all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards I have just %% described %% . Such performance is a great tribute to American scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where America had none before . This year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with Polaris missiles .
describe.v | 3 | It is the chief merit in Copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent . He can not , e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth 's own motion . He can not %% describe %% eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem . In Ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations . In a systematic astronomy , like that of Copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system ; ; they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .
describe.v | 1 | American democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith . Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . And he %% describes %% it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law . I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental law . But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .
describe.v | 1 | Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by %% describing %% in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .
describe.v | 1 | What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse . Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability . One girl %% describes %% her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion . If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ? `` Most often '' , she says , `` it 's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest '' .
describe.v | 1 | His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term . Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley %% described %% as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship .

describe.v | 1 | `` O ! ! Pioneers ! ! '' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to %% describe %% how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .
describe.v | 1 | Richard Brinsley Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he ca n't understand his own meaning '' . There are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been %% described %% by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . In common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition .
development.n | 1 | Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $ 38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month , sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan . Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone . `` When I saw the Lexus sales projections , I got worried , '' confesses Takashi Oka , who led the Infiniti %% development %% team . But on reflection , Mr. Oka says , he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus . `` Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. Oka says .
development.n | 1 | But to Mitsubishi Estate , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides . First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share . Secondly , the two companies found a similarity in their business and %% development %% philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications . Finally , Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller 's management beyond taking a place on the board . `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi .
development.n | 1 | According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third . The SEC 's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates . The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and %% development %% , Mr. Lane said . The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said . Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time .
development.n | 1 | Under the accord , Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray 's fledgling operation $ 53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend Cray Computer $ 98.6 million . Cray Research will retain a 10 % interest in the new company , which will be based in Colorado Springs , Colo . When it announced the planned breakup in May , Cray Research said %% development %% costs of several competing projects were squeezing its earnings growth . After the split , the two companies presumably will be rivals for orders from government and commercial customers .
development.n | 1 | If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline . It 's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects . Douglas Stoneman , vice president of Shell Canada , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down %% development %% . Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards . Instead , Richard Haskayne , president and chief executive of Interprovincial 's Calgary-based parent , Interhome Energy Inc. , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal .
development.n | 1 | It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop . Their report galvanized other molecular biologists . `` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that { gene } losses were critical to the %% development %% of a common tumor , '' says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City . But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy . They focused on chromosome 17 .
development.n | 1 | And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ? An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market . For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the %% development %% of a free market . Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council ) . Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
development.n | 3 | By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party . At the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism . The most important %% development %% in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism . An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims . It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism .
development.n | 1 | In 1991 , the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space , the first Japanese to go into orbit . Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the U.S. , Japan 's principal ally . `` We have never opposed the %% development %% of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union , '' says a State Department official . `` Frankly , I would n't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the Soviets . '' Under Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika , the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .
development.n | 1 | Mr. Bologna said the sale would allow Gen-Probe to speed up the development of new technology , and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer . By 1988 , when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration , eight of them had been developed and sold by Gen-Probe . Osamu Nagayama , deputy president of Chugai , which spends about 15 % of its sales on research and %% development %% , was unable to pinpoint how much money Chugai would pump into Gen-Probe . `` We think Gen-Probe has technology important to people 's health , '' he said , adding : `` We think it is important for us to have such technology . '' He and Mr. Bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of Gen-Probe , which will expand `` significantly '' as a result of the acquisition .
development.n | 1 | P&G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition . Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics . That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product %% development %% will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands . `` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal . `` You 'll see fewer gimmicks . ''
development.n | 1 | Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under %% development %% . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
development.n | 1 | `` We must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges . '' He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up . One of those areas is the %% development %% of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them . The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent , verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud . The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail .
development.n | 1 | Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left . New York authorities , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it . `` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic %% development %% . Meanwhile , Dallas welcomed the move . City officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name `` Everglades . ''
development.n | 1 | On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them . `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems %% development %% . Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year . `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
development.n | 1 | The company said the situation in the U.S. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings . Analysts said SKF 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor . The three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales %% development %% . Sales of rolling bearings increased 19 % to 15.7 billion kronor from 13.2 billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year .
development.n | 2 | Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $ 500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts . The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin , a Newport Beach , Calif. , architectural firm , to design what the Japanese press has dubbed `` the Beverly Hills of Tokyo . '' Instead of Japan 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` One Hundred Hills '' %% development %% will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots . That 's more than 10 times the usual housing site size . Buyers with $ 6 million to spend can select from 11 designs , including a Mediterranean-inspired California style , a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright .
development.n | 1 | Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and Toyota 's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring . But drivers in the U.S. must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only . And Detroit 's Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under %% development %% . In the engine department , several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space , allowing for shorter hoods . In the so-called two-stroke engines , which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once to provide power .
development.n | 1 | Larry Birns , director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs , a liberal research group , said that Latin American countries would be `` profoundly disappointed '' if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS . `` Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty , '' he said . The OAS , which tries to promote peace and economic %% development %% within the Americas , is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis . Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership , but the organization 's members are discussing Cuba 's reinstatement .
development.n | 1 | Those who are n't worried about how Japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports . Although imports account for less than 1 % of beer sales in Japan , Asahi Breweries Ltd. , which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer , plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $ 1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50 % more beer . But new-product %% development %% will make Japanese companies stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market . Moreover , much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition ; so , more investment practically assures more exports . Toshiba Corp. , for example , is spending $ 986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories , the next generation of computer chips .
development.n | 1 | Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share . Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 . Mr. Krampe also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product %% development %% cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with Toyota Motor Corp.

development.n | 3 | He cautioned , however , that a `` tough tax-rate comparison '' may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter . For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said . While the third period contained no major surprises , Mr. Lothson said , the results show how sensitive the multinationals can be to %% developments %% in a single country such as Brazil . He also questioned whether recent gains in that country can be sustained . The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
development.n | 1 | Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations . Some plan to pursue foreign development ventures , mostly in Europe . And other developers may shift from commercial to residential %% development %% in the U.S. . `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago , '' says Charles Shaw , a Chicago-based real estate developer . `` So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties .
development.n | 3 | With the advantage of playing white ( which moves first ) , Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted . As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight . This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside %% development %% . `` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later . In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . ''
development.n | 1 | The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the %% development %% of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's . Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .
development.n | 3 | Fireman 's Fund property-liability subsidiaries reported a 120.7 % combined underwriting ratio for the nine months , up from 108.4 % for the year-ago period . Hurricane Hugo accounted for about $ 36 million in pretax third-quarter losses , net of reinsurance recoveries . The company said there was an additional increase in loss and loss-expense reserves of $ 71 million reflecting `` higher than expected '' %% development %% in claims legal expenses from to prior periods . For the third quarter , net premiums were $ 742 million , up 9.6 % from $ 677 million in last year 's quarter , because of the expiration of the National Indemnity quota share reinsurance agreement . Net premiums written through Sept. 30 fell 5 % to $ 2.1 billion from $ 2.2 billion a year ago , because of the writing of fewer policies at flat prices , the company said .
development.n | 1 | If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J.

And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
development.n | 1 | The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund . The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said . The spun-off concern `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate %% development %% companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said . For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio . Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ 71.9 million from $ 143 million a year earlier , the company said .
development.n | 1 | Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories . Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group . Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and %% development %% . U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese . Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips .
development.n | 1 | Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem . Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture . While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business %% development %% . A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization . It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .

The answer will be obvious . Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department 's National Institute of Justice .
development.n | 1 | But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures . The latest %% developments %% in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society , the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments . The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research . Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end .

One price-depressing %% development %% was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2 % in the consumer price index for September , an analyst said . He noted that the `` core inflation rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at 0.2 % .

Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually , and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .

As you mentioned , subsidies for %% development %% on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System . The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 .

The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult . Mr. Bush even %% disclosed %% privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator , Manuel Noriega , if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life . The president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive .

do.v | 1 | The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige . The demonstrators have been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute . It might be alleged that TV has %% done %% more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of `` chickens coming home to roost .

It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography . As they %% did %% when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children . As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school . Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a `` language schizophrenia . ''

'' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply %% doing %% what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) . He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ? Primarily because there 's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan 's personal values , or lack of them .

And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one said I should n't '' and brazen it out .

While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences , both cultural and philosophic , I question his perspective .

The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50 % stake , also from Beghin-Say .
do.v | 1 | Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange . Last month , program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day , or a record 13.8 % of the Big Board 's average daily volume .

And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . This ministry has %% done %% nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries . All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers .

do.v | 1 | But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it . If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to %% do %% . There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message . Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .

They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . Hence , as they see it , if something is n't %% done %% earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time .
do.v | 1 | Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this . Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics . `` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they %% did %% it , '' says Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school . `` What you have here is intuition made manifest . '' Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence .

do.v | 1 | Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually %% do %% hiring . `` Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity ?

Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to %% do %% significant experimentation in that country , they said . The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .

Meanwhile , Mr. Gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $ 100 million in SCI TV if the company ca n't be restructured . Overall , Mr. Gillett 's holding company , Gillett Holdings , is heavily indebted and , except for its Vail Mountain resorts , is n't %% doing %% very well . With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years , analysts say that if SCI TV had to be liquidated today , it might fetch 30 % less than in the 1987 buy-out , wiping out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders . Meanwhile , SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill , and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due .

( In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . ) `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
do.v | 1 | William D. Forrester , president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to %% do %% business in the Soviet Union . `` It 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' Mr. Forrester says . `` We are not trying to encourage everyone . ''
do.v | 1 | `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names { of the senators } will be brought out , '' Mr. Gonzalez says . This is raising eyebrows . `` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and %% do %% this , '' says Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group . `` There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position . ''
do.v | 1 | At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to %% do %% chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal . At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
do.v | 1 | Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . `` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . I 'm not going to %% do %% anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home . But that does n't mean I 'm not going to get angry . '' Michael Eskridge , president of CNBC , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort ! Mort ! Mort ! ''
do.v | 1 | Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play ? The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action . President Bush would %% do %% himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security . There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars . The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed .
do.v | 2 | Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power . In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work . When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would %% do %% well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
do.v | 1 | But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped . They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . '' It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to %% do %% . Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives . Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold .
do.v | 1 | Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get %% done %% . `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . `` If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
do.v | 2 | One week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision . But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough . `` You want to know how a fund %% did %% when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco . `` It 's like kicking the tires of a car ... . What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform ? ''
do.v | 2 | A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are %% doing %% almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
do.v | 1 | Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife . The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees . The study was %% done %% by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide . What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa . Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks .
do.v | 1 | All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads . `` The { ministry } thinks the banks do n't know what they are %% doing %% , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified . `` The { ministry } wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added . Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
do.v | 1 | With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to %% do %% its job of coordinating foreign policy ? President Bush 's national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration . Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair .
do.v | 1 | These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm . Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are %% doing %% so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately . There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them . At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
do.v | 2 | But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy . When he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . '' Still others are stung by a desire to %% do %% both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division . Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches . But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
do.v | 1 | He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to %% do %% it out of current income , '' he says . `` That 's crazy . '' His advice : Do n't panic .
do.v | 1 | Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health . Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was %% doing %% it already ! We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it . Bank it ?
do.v | 1 | Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're %% doing %% is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
do.v | 1 | A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is %% doing %% the work . The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
do.v | 1 | The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group . Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air . Even rank amateurs can %% do %% it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . ''
do.v | 5 | Try as they might , they just ca n't conceive of life without black workers . `` Impossible , impossible , '' say the Conradies , an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades . `` We ca n't %% do %% without their help , '' says Mrs. Conradie . `` Oh no . We need them and I thank God for them . ''
do.v | 1 | The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently . Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten . But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has %% done %% in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories . Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists . Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months , and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .
do.v | 1 | Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says . It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` He %% did %% it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain power . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy .
do.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you %% doing %% planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
drug.n | 2 | The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to %% drug %% use . Richard Avena , executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union , called the proposal `` political gimmickry , '' and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue .
drug.n | 1 | Boyer and Cohen , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the Patent Office refused to grant it . That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court , leaving Cohen and Boyer holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA ( now assigned to their schools ) . Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the %% drug %% business . Genentech 's 1988 sales were $ 335 million , both from licensing and its own products .
drug.n | 1 | The typical healthy heart beats 70 times a minute . The drug , called adenocard , returns the heart to a normal rhythm within seconds , according to Lyphomed . Medco Research developed the %% drug %% and licensed it to Lyphomed for sale in the U.S. and Canada .
drug.n | 1 | G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone , a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern . Searle , a unit of Monsanto Co. , said the `` beta-blocker '' high-blood-pressure %% drug %% Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals , the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo , a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France 's L'Oreal S.A .
drug.n | 2 | Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $ 10,000 or more . But wire transfers from a standing account -- including those bigger than $ 10,000 -- are n't reported . Officials believe this has left a gaping loophole that illegal %% drug %% businesses are exploiting . Authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the U.S. total about $ 110 billion annually . Sen. John Kerry ( D. , Mass. ) , chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering , criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on U.S. wire systems .
drug.n | 1 | The Supreme Court let stand a New York court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown . The high court 's action , refusing to hear appeals by several %% drug %% companies , is likely to have a significant impact at several levels . The most immediate effect is in New York , where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state . The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug .
drug.n | 1 | In 1971 , the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug . Lawsuits over the harm caused by DES have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade . In many cases , the lawsuit was filed long after the %% drug %% was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women . Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed . But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined .
drug.n | 1 | Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects , Lancet , the British medical journal , reported in 1987 . However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys . The %% drug %% has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it . All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion . A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486 .
drug.n | 1 | Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question . RU-486 `` probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed , or at least not very much , '' said Phillip Stubblefield , president of the National Abortion Federation , at a reproductive health conference in 1986 . Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the %% drug %% fails to induce an abortion . It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration 's approval for a new drug , and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ 30 million to $ 70 million . The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $ 8 million contraceptive program .
drug.n | 1 | At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress , a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $ 10 million grant for `` development , evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices , drugs and methods . '' If this passes -- a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time . It also could put the government into the RU-486 business , which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector %% drug %% industry . We do not know whether RU-486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking , uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better . ( Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills ? )
drug.n | 1 | Estee Lauder , for example , spends only an estimated 5 % of sales on advertising in the U.S. , and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy . The most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new-product development . Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as %% drug %% stores and supermarkets , according to Andrew Shore , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . That figure has been inching up for several years . As the trend continues , demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase .
drug.n | 1 | Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan . Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992 . Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic %% drugs %% and veterinary products . Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. Bergsma said . Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .
drug.n | 1 | On Friday , the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report . `` A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used , '' the American association said . The FDA already requires %% drug %% manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products . Eli Lilly & Co. , the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer , dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin . Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein , France .
drug.n | 2 | The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars . So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about . I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the %% drug %% problem . The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work .
drug.n | 2 | With these incentives , demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it . It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it . Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy %% drugs %% at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost . When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves . They wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market .
drug.n | 2 | Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid . Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter . In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to %% drug %% cases . '' Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . '' Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
drug.n | 2 | Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade , but it has not been sufficiently effective , because , unfortunately , it came too late . Ten years ago , the newspaper El Espectador , of which my brother Guillermo was editor , began warning of the rise of the %% drug %% mafias and of their leaders ' aspirations to control Colombian politics , especially the Congress . Then , when it would have been easier to resist them , nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago . The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia 's .
drug.n | 2 | If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world . The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive . The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace %% drugs %% posed to the moral structure of their country . Even now , the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat . I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan .
drug.n | 2 | More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports , and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated . The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons , explosives and other war-like materiel . Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but , on the other hand , none of the key %% drug %% barons have been captured . There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money . In my opinion , this is not true .
drug.n | 2 | I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by The Wall Street Journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper , to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs . Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge . A crusade of NO to the consumption of %% drugs %% is imperative . Mr. Cano is president of El Espectador , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
drug.n | 2 | Saturday , Oct. 28 , 8-10 p.m. EDT , on HBO ( repeated Oct. 31 , Nov. 5 , 8 , 14 , 16 and 20 ) : `` Perfect Witness . '' Aidan Quinn , Brian Dennehy and Stockard Channing are excellent in this gripping tale of a reluctant witness in an organized crime prosecution . It 's set in New York , but it resonates with the terrible dynamics of the Latin American %% drug %% wars . Sunday , Oct. 29 , 8-11 p.m. EST , on ABC : `` The Final Days . '' No doubt there is something to irk everyone in this AT&T-sponsored dramatization of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 's book about Watergate .
drug.n | 1 | A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks , Calif. , recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson . A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge , Mass . The %% drug %% is being used primarily to treat anemias . A new experiment , reported in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine , involved giving injections of Amgen 's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood . The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery .
drug.n | 1 | Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services . The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease . The %% drug %% will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug 's usage for adults in March 1987 .
drug.n | 1 | The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the %% drug %% 's usage for adults in March 1987 . But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
drug.n | 1 | Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take . Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills . Since then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the %% drug %% in his program . To some mothers , the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been . `` My first reaction is I do n't understand why it 's taken so long .
drug.n | 1 | The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on %% drug %% distribution operations .
drug.n | 2 | He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January . Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President Francois Mitterrand and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez . `` I demand the utmost severity in the fight against %% drug %% traffickers , '' President Mitterrand said after the meeting in Valladolid , Spain . He added : `` Banks must open their books . '' The leaders ' talks coincided with a meeting in Madrid of anti-drug experts from the U.S. , France , Italy , Spain , Peru , Bolivia and Colombia .
drug.n | 2 | This is not the case . The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative . It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI 's role would be to continue targeting the major %% drug %% traffickers through our National Drug Strategy . Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market . The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) .
drug.n | 1 | He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing . AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease . Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the %% drug %% under the name Retrovir . A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan . But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir .
drug.n | 2 | PLO leader Arafat asked Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula . Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from %% drugs %% to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . '' At a meeting in Malaysia , Australia and Canada also assailed the British prime minister for criticizing the 49-nation group 's call for Pretoria to ease apartheid .
drug.n | 2 | I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial `` Colombia 's Brave Publisher . '' It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the %% drug %% traffickers , not the left wing . This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region . Past Colombian government tolerance of the `` narcotraficantes '' was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
drug.n | 1 | Amgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia %% drug %% for kidney patients . The Thousand Oaks , Calif.-based biotechnology company reported a 97 % increase in revenue to $ 42.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 . In the year-ago period , Amgen reported net income of $ 320,000 , or two cents a share , on revenue of $ 21.5 million .
drug.n | 1 | American Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA . No safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said . An FDA spokesperson said the %% drugs %% are still available under other brand names . Last month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit . It also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry .
drug.n | 2 | William Bennett , the White House drug-policy director , accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted %% drug %% dealers . `` Politics has essentially put up a roadblock '' to finding sites for new federal prisons , Mr. Bennett said at a news conference called to report on his `` emergency assistance program '' for the capital . Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals , he added , `` we will not win the war on drugs . ''
drug.n | 2 | He acknowledged , however , that Washington 's `` drug-related murder rate is intolerably high . The prisons are too crowded . %% Drugs %% continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . '' Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem . But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
drug.n | 2 | Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing . As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . '' As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's %% drug %% business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war . This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war . '' Unfortunately , this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment .
drug.n | 1 | American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels . Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to $ 1.51 billion from $ 1.42 billion . Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter , based in part on strong sales of prescription %% drugs %% such as Premarin , an estrogen-replacement drug , and sales of the company 's infant formula . American Home Products said net income benefited from a `` lower effective tax rate , '' reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates , and additional operations in Puerto Rico . Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company 's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1 .
drug.n | 1 | Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , New York , the newly merged %% drug %% and health-care-product company , reported record third-quarter earnings for both companies in the merger . Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. , Princeton , N.J. , merged Oct. 4 , but the new company reported third-period earnings for both companies . For the fourth quarter , Bristol-Myers Squibb will report one set of earnings .
drug.n | 1 | In addition , Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores . Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients . `` We believe that every %% drug %% that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a Ralph Nader affiliate . Dr. Teich said Searle is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available . According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
drug.n | 2 | Housing and Urban Development 's budget is $ 17 billion . From what we and the nation have been reading , the money is n't being spent very well . The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of %% drugs %% out of their neighborhoods . If that takes money , take it away from this discredited federal department . But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind .
drug.n | 2 | A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle . A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer . Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the %% drug %% gangs . Until then , the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted . It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
drug.n | 1 | Analysts in London believe investors , despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks , should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares , this newspaper 's Heard on the Street column said yesterday . Amgen rose 1 1\/2 to 50 3\/4 in heavy trading . Analysts figure Amgen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor , Genetics Institute , over the anti-anemia %% drug %% EPO . Genetics Institute disclosed recently that it is embroiled in a dispute with Boehringer Mannheim , which distributes the drug , regarding the usability of some batches .
drug.n | 1 | A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh , according to researchers . The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration , and its long-term effects are unknown . But researchers say the %% drug %% , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates . Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year . Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
drug.n | 1 | The Pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug , which is made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co . `` We 're shocked by it , because it 's worked so fast , '' said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl , director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program , at a news conference here yesterday . `` We consider it a life-saving %% drug %% , like one for AIDS , '' said Dr. John Fung , an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh . Researchers say they believe FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug , cyclosporine , made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd . They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506 , compared with cyclosporine , which can cause renal failure , morbidity , nausea and other problems .
drug.n | 1 | Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 % and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients . Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds , and that Fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants . He said that the research team had no financial stake in the %% drug %% . `` We 've known for six months the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , '' Dr. Starzl said , adding that profiting from FK-506 would n't be ethical .

'' I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote . I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two %% drugs %% , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients . With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer . This is not nearly good enough .
drug.n | 2 | `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' Even at this early stage , %% drugs %% caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .
drug.n | 2 | Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively . During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on %% drug %% charges . But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him , recalls his close ally Jose Blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua . Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama .
drug.n | 1 | Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings , bolstered by strong sales of newer , big-selling prescriptions %% drugs %% that provide hefty profit margins . Merck & Co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings ; Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22 % and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24 % . The results were in line with analysts ' expectations .
drug.n | 1 | Sales for the quarter rose to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.03 billion . Prescription-drug world-wide sales rose 9 % in the quarter to $ 340 million ; U.S. sales rose 15 % . The segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular %% drugs %% Lopid , a lipid regulator , and Dilzem , a calcium channel blocker . World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert 's non-prescription health-care products , such as Halls cough tablets , Rolaids antacid , and Lubriderm skin lotion , increased 3 % to $ 362 million in the third quarter ; U.S. sales rose 5 % . Confectionery products sales also had strong growth in the quarter .
effect.n | 1 | It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air . All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material %% effect %% on the company 's strategic plan . '' Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim .
effect.n | 1 | Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed . The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing , high-production trait known as `` hybrid vigor , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn . `` The development could have a dramatic %% effect %% on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains . That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant .
effect.n | 3 | Faced with inevitable defeat , the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban , which covers all but a fraction of 1 % of daily flights in the U.S. . The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska . Assuming final enactment this month , the prohibition will take %% effect %% 96 days later , or in early February . On a 394-21 roll call , the House adopted the underlying transportation measure . But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ 3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs .
effect.n | 1 | Four people torched three U.S. flags on the central steps of the U.S. Capitol in a bid to test a new federal law protecting the American flag from desecration . All four demonstrators were arrested . The law , which Bush allowed to take %% effect %% without his signature , went into force Friday . Chinese officials said armed police would replace soldiers in Tiananmen Square as part of a scaling down of Beijing 's five-month-old state of emergency . Separately , the U.S. Embassy has filed three protests in as many days with China 's government , alleging harassment of diplomats and their families , an embassy source said .
effect.n | 1 | Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined . The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting %% effect %% on either Boeing or its work force . The company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared with $ 53.6 billion at the end of Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ 5 billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 .
effect.n | 1 | Each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The %% effect %% is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension . ( Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz , and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz ) Government Contractors
effect.n | 3 | For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed . Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death . In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in %% effect %% in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff . The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years . `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member .

But the kids with highly educated parents did 68 % less housework than those in less-educated families . `` It is clear , '' Ms. Waite says , `` that most of the %% effect %% of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife\/mother .

effect.n | 1 | Unless the Soviet Union collapses , German reunification is likely to require Germany 's neutralization . The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the %% effects %% of tax-rate reduction on capital flows . Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan .
effect.n | 1 | He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System . While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death . To make matters even more confusing , the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound %% effects %% on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling . They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows . By accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade deficit .
effect.n | 1 | It reduces the baseline by $ 169 billion . Finally , Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2 % per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion . This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering %% effects %% of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union . The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses . They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations .
effect.n | 1 | Wall Street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks . For three years , a healthy economy and the export-boosting %% effects %% of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels . As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp , a raw material used in all sorts of paper , to $ 830 a metric ton this past spring from $ 380 a ton at the start of 1986 . But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply .
effect.n | 3 | Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take %% effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

effect.n | 3 | The Justice Department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a Pittsburgh suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped . This would be the department 's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act . Under those amendments , which took %% effect %% in March of this year , the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits . The ordinance , in Moon Township , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility . In papers filed with the federal district court in Pittsburgh , the Justice Department alleged that the ordinance , by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township , makes housing unavailable on account of handicap .
effect.n | 1 | Why do you continually ignore the salubrious %% effects %% of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation ? Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ? I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
effect.n | 3 | The 1986 Tax Reform Act has nearly eliminated the number of large , profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax , according to Citizens for Tax Justice , a nonprofit , labor-funded research and lobbying group . In a study of 250 of the nation 's richest companies , the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with 40 in 1986 , the last year the old tax rules were in %% effect %% , and 16 in 1987 , when some of the new tax provisions went into effect . Moreover , 41 companies that paid no federal income tax from 1981 through 1985 -- despite billions of dollars of profits -- ended up paying an average of 27.9 % of their income in federal taxes in 1988 . The report , released yesterday , comes as Congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax-revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes .

effect.n | 1 | Many analysts are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year . Investors now are awaiting today 's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product . Economists predict the report will show economic growth of about 2.5 % in the third quarter , which would have little %% effect %% on financial markets .

The measure , which will take %% effect %% next Wednesday , will create a two-tier exchange rate . Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar . But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar .
effect.n | 2 | I will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making . Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama , or anything else , without foul-mouthed cursing . Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script , and high-tech special %% effects %% are continually substituted for good plot and character development . In short , we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating . Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex , violence and gutter language are included as a crutch .
effect.n | 1 | So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd. , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant . The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo . But whatever its %% effects %% on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand . Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s . Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .

The %% effects %% on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally .

Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said . Moreover , the extensive program in %% effect %% establishes a floor for the stock price , said Joel Price , analyst for Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .

effect.n | 1 | -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero %% effect %% on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers . There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .

If the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an %% effect %% on the company 's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year , which begins Dec. 1 . Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 . If the ship fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more .

In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested . It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the %% effect %% she appears to want . One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments .

effect.n | 1 | For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the %% effects %% of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols . Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .

Last week , when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble . `` The %% effect %% of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters . Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion .

effect.n | 1 | As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . But the compounded %% effects %% of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates . Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax . Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 .
effect.n | 1 | Inmac Corp. , a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories , said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds . The company paid five cents a share in April . The directors ' action , taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday , had little or no %% effect %% on the company 's stock , which stagnated at $ 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading . Inmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share . Sales rose 12 % to $ 249.5 million from $ 222.8 million .
effect.n | 1 | As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do . That %% effect %% holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds . But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon . Long-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price .
effect.n | 1 | Tokyo stocks , which rebounded strongly Tuesday , extended their gains yesterday , but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower . In London , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1 . The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the %% effects %% of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market . The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses . The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5 .
effect.n | 1 | On Thursday , the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section , which gained 0.24 point Wednesday , was up 22.78 , or 0.86 % , at 2665.66 . The morning session was dominated by individuals and dealers , but some institutions participated in the afternoon , encouraged by the market 's firmness , traders said . Sentiment was helped by the small gain made by New York stocks Wednesday despite anxiety over possible %% effects %% of the major earthquake that struck northern California Tuesday . Having survived both last Friday 's 6.9 % Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the San Francisco Bay area earthquake , Tokyo market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal . Hiroyuki Murai , general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities , said that after looking at the reasons for Friday 's Wall Street plunge , participants realized that the Tokyo and New York markets have different economic fundamentals .
effect.n | 1 | William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term %% effect %% of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product . It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways . `` It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help , '' says Beth Burnham Mace , a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill , a Lexington , Mass. , forecasting firm .

effect.n | 1 | Bank Building , which builds and equips banks , had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year , which ends Oct. 31 . On Oct. 5 , the company estimated after-tax effects on the year 's earnings would be `` at least '' $ 1.3 million . Yesterday , the company said the negative after-tax %% effect %% on earnings for the year will be about $ 3.3 million . For the nine months ended July 31 , Bank Building had a net loss of $ 1 million , on revenue of $ 66.5 million . Bank Building , which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss , said it engaged advisers to `` explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units .

effect.n | 1 | `` This is one of the worst trade releases we 've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987 , '' said Geoffrey Dennis , chief international economist at James Capel Inc . Like most analysts , Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month 's numbers ; but he said , `` It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe . '' The number had a troubling %% effect %% on Wall Street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide . The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73 . `` This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist for Mellon Bank .
effect.n | 1 | Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He said that ill %% effects %% from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said .
effect.n | 1 | A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh , according to researchers . The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration , and its long-term effects are unknown . But researchers say the drug , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side %% effects %% and by lowering rejection rates . Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year . Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
effect.n | 1 | After touring the area , California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the Associated Press reported . The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives . But there are other long-term %% effects %% that raise serious questions about the ability of California 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor . It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ 250 million , said Charles J. O'Connell , deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation , nicknamed Caltrans . Caltrans in Sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ 500 million .
effect.n | 1 | Some economists expect further declines in investment spending . `` Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently , '' Mr. Harris said . `` You have n't seen the full %% effect %% of that yet . '' A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies , the Fed noted . Analysts do n't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months .
effect.n | 3 | An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35 % , Mr. Gurria said . The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans . The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of Mexico 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into %% effect %% in early China 's top film actress , Liu Xiaoqing , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in Shandong province , the People 's Daily reported .

Secretary of State Baker expressed concern that Nicaraguan President Ortega may attempt to use alleged attacks by the U.S.backed Contra rebels as an excuse to scuttle elections scheduled for February . Ortega had threatened to %% end %% a 19-month-old ceasefire . Baker 's remarks came as the White House urged both sides to honor the truce .

Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night . Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would %% end %% the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army . Saturday , he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras . He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels .

Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters . About the same time , the Iran-Iraq war , which was roiling oil markets , %% ended %% .

end.v | 1 | COCOA : The modest sell-off , which started on Tuesday , continued . The December contract %% ended %% at $ 999 a metric ton , down $ 15 . The market is drifting , at least partly , because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast , the two largest African producers . Harry Schwartz , a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York , said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12 .

The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year %% ending %% Tuesday . The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 . The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions wo n't affect the payment of dividends .
end.v | 1 | `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . '' Changes in CD yields in the week %% ended %% Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months . Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year . The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85 % .
end.v | 1 | Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious , '' he says .

Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact .
end.v | 1 | Japan 's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August . Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year %% ending %% March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 . As a result , brokerage house officials said , appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable . Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
end.v | 4 | It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results . It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy . I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might %% end %% up a schoolteacher . They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses . But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .

Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales . The Treasury 's 30-year bond %% ended %% over 1\/4 point higher . Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1\/8 to 1\/2 point . But high-yield , high-risk bonds fell 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered .

West Germany 's 7 % issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01 % , while the 6 3\/4 % issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33 % .

Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years %% ended %% in June of this year ; that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period . A year at Harvard now goes for $ 19,395 .

The index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall . London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September .
end.v | 1 | Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change . Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz . Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II %% ended %% . Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .

I had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .
end.v | 2 | Does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may %% end %% our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ? Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth . Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?
end.v | 1 | Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty . The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures %% ends %% with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff . They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace . Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .
end.v | 1 | The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people . But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways . Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter %% ended %% by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man . The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure . There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .

They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and %% ended %% . Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .

The freight car was cold , early in the morning . He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
end.v | 3 | No temptation , no sin . No temptation , no virtue ? ? A curious thought to %% end %% a curious night . The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf . Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden .
enjoy.v | 1 | It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who %% enjoy %% wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) .

enjoy.v | 2 | Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up . A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which %% enjoy %% considerable backing from the Japanese government . Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .
enjoy.v | 1 | `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz %% enjoys %% asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
enjoy.v | 1 | For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular March counterpart ; ; but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; ; and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; ; and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had %% enjoyed %% the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel . And like Jo March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe Jastrow , and Sadie by Max Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi .
enjoy.v | 1 | Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples . Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and %% enjoy %% it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .
enjoy.v | 1 | Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right . Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves . Winston %% enjoyed %% seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style . When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace . At home , he would n't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .

For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and %% enjoyed %% the usual routine of the infant . She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city 's special nursery . Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began .

enjoy.v | 1 | My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face . In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed . In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to %% enjoy %% conversing with me in rudimentary phrases . Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things . For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .
enjoy.v | 1 | The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea . For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity . She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had %% enjoyed %% when she was a child . Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested . An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .

But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I %% enjoyed %% it . Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie . Johnnie I suddenly realized he 'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .

estimate.v | 1 | The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published . The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed . The institute did n't %% estimate %% annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 . The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
estimate.v | 1 | It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush . Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin , but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president , who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills . Yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills , an %% estimated %% $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health and Human Services . To gain more leverage , abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month . But the stark numbers yesterday -- when 282 votes were needed -- indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year .
estimate.v | 1 | The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law . By a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters , and budget analysts %% estimate %% the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress . The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991 , and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta , whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week . Going to the well of the chamber , Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted .

REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses , but do n't bet that contractors ' unreported income will be detected that way . The General Accounting Office %% estimates %% that 50 % of IRS audits do n't spot companies that fail to file the reports . UH HUH : A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $ 500 to go into a bank and change $ 44,400 in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the Tax Court found .

'' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to %% estimate %% how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .

estimate.v | 1 | At 500 yen ( $ 3.60 ) for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II . But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen ( almost $ 92 billion ) , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry . And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers %% estimate %% the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen . If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .

Experts %% estimate %% the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars . Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price . Nevertheless , Kodak could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur .
estimate.v | 1 | Amtech Systems Inc. , Tempe , Ariz. , said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate `` substantial improvement '' over the previous fiscal year . Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are %% estimated %% at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million . Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November .

estimate.v | 1 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house %% estimated %% the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .

Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge . Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market .
estimate.v | 1 | New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes . Quack . The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans %% estimates %% that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range . The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .
estimate.v | 1 | What 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' says Mr. Stapf , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected . So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . Nobody can %% estimate %% the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery . His group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners . Surveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all .

The harvest arrives in plenty after last year 's drought-ravaged effort : The government %% estimates %% corn output at 7.45 billion bushels , up 51 % from last fall . Soybean production swells 24 % . As a result , prices paid to farmers for the commodities , which are used in products as diverse as bubble gum and chicken feed , plummet 20 % to 33 % .

He 'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd %% estimated %% the shot had come . But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted . There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .

They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov , but they put their hope in D.T. 's recently enhanced capacity for %% examining %% positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 . But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded .
examine.v | 1 | In this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community . An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence . If we %% examine %% the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke . The first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society . The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .
examine.v | 1 | The making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business . Lincoln 's slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision . But because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely %% examine %% the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang . Only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy 's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics . In his recent evaluation of Kennedy 's potentialities for leadership , Walter Lippmann has cited the `` precision '' of his mind , his `` immense command '' of factual detail , and his `` instinct for the crucial point '' as impressive in the extreme ; ; and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual 's command of language interacts with the other two .
examine.v | 1 | Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy . He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never %% examined %% ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal . The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the secrets . By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings .

Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore . Dr. Louis Lalaurie %% examined %% the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead . The ball broke up in confusion . Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .
examine.v | 2 | Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news . No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was %% examined %% , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
exchange.n | 3 | Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic carriers , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 . Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary . Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock %% exchange %% ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions . China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony . The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .
exchange.n | 1 | The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants ' district . At the time , Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center . Mitsubishi built the government 's dream development , the story goes , in %% exchange %% for the official decision to locate Tokyo 's central railway station there . That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government-business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties . Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's Mitsubishi group .
exchange.n | 1 | An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company 's loss was smaller on a cash basis . Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , Italy and Taiwan . In a related development , Avery said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers , Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May , surrendered warrants and preferred stock in %% exchange %% for a larger stake in Avery 's common shares . On a fully diluted basis , the two raised their stake to 68 % from 51 % . In December 1988 , Messrs. Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc. , a packaging company they controlled , to Pechiney Corp. of France .
exchange.n | 3 | But in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said , `` We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation . Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades . He said he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program trading and the %% exchange %% 's role in it that has raged in recent days . Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some investors want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . '' The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that .
exchange.n | 3 | `` The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions , '' meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the Big Board 's electronic trading system , Mr. Phelan said . That was when the exchange took a new tack by publishing monthly statistics listing the top 15 program trading firms . %% Exchange %% officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading . People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it . Meanwhile , another big Wall Street brokerage firm joined others that have been pulling back from program trading .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We are looking for representation we have n't had , '' a specialist said . `` We 've had dictation . '' After another session Mr. Phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said , `` Clearly , the firms want the %% exchange %% to take leadership . '' Many specialist firms resent the Big Board 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index in one shot . Ultimately , the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise .
exchange.n | 3 | Lewis L. Glucksman , vice chairman of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , said : `` This is a problem that 's taking on a life of its own . The program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market , and even Europeans are suspicious . The %% exchange %% should take a pro-active position . '' For now , however , Mr. Phelan said : `` I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory . We have a major problem , and that problem is volatility . ''
exchange.n | 5 | These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions . In an interest-rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period . In a forward-rate agreement , a client agrees to an %% exchange %% rate on a future currency transaction . Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem . Started three years ago , Chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field .
exchange.n | 5 | Mr. Salinas 's unpopular Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , faces congressional elections in 1991 . For the PRI to stand a chance , Mr. Salinas has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth . But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign %% exchange %% . Mr. Salinas needs big investment inflows -- quickly . The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on Mr. Salinas .
exchange.n | 3 | Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading . Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account , and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether . At the New York Stock Exchange , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the %% exchange %% 's own listed companies , Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board 's 49 stock specialist firms . The specialists , a trader said , were `` livid '' about Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are `` here to stay . '' Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13 .
exchange.n | 3 | Mr. Phelan 's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow , according to exchange officials . A Big Board spokesman would only say , `` We 're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue . '' The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board 's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the %% exchange %% 's role in program trading . The decision by Merrill , the nation 's largest securities firm , represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading . Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year , executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades , or about one million shares a day .
exchange.n | 3 | Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l , 1975 . The timing for change was right . Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought %% exchange %% seats to handle their own trades . And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets . Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of 35 % to 60 % below pre-May 1 levels .
exchange.n | 3 | Several of the New York Stock Exchange 's own listed companies , led by giant Contel Corp. , are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the %% exchange %% 's role in it . Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a `` gambling casino , '' Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance . The group , Mr. Wohlstetter said in an interview , wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies .
exchange.n | 3 | The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading . Richard Grasso , Big Board president , last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents . Privately , %% exchange %% officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board , billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London 's . It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade . One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange .
exchange.n | 3 | One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange . Investors have complained for some time about program trading , particularly index arbitrage , to little avail . But according to some Big Board traders , an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the %% exchange %% finally consider big changes . `` They wo n't fight the listed companies . Now the assault is on , '' said one top trader .
exchange.n | 5 | As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . To keep the %% exchange %% rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
exchange.n | 5 | British politicians divide into two groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling . So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher . The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and %% exchange %% rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps . There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates . There are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates .
exchange.n | 5 | At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the %% exchange %% rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS . Faced with a similar situation , Paul Volcker let the dollar soar , ( though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation ) . But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism .

exchange.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil futures marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the %% exchange %% falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange . On Friday , the Merc 's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co. 's Henry Hub in Erath , La. , as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract . It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it .
exchange.n | 3 | Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange . Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board . '' Mr. Thompson first came to the %% exchange %% in 1981 and has been executive vice president since March 1988 . He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel . By contrast , the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider , Arnold F. Staloff , as its president .
exchange.n | 3 | The Merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil , gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York , and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . In a recent interview , Mr. Thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image . Earlier this year , the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago %% exchanges %% . Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May , though no indictments have been handed down there . So far they have issued scores of subpoenas , some of which went to members of the New York Merc .
exchange.n | 3 | It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years . It also had both the fewest , and least experienced , investigators per million contracts traded . The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director , Kevin P. Conway , who then was responsible for policing the %% exchange %% 's busy oil and metal pits , `` was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time , '' including out-of-state trips , according to a New York Merc report prepared last year . Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange . `` We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance , '' Mr. Thompson says .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York %% exchanges %% have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . So far there is little to show for such efforts .
exchange.n | 3 | In January , the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called Globex . But in May , the Chicago Merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the Chicago Board of Trade , and it suspended negotiations with the New York Merc . Mr. Thompson says his %% exchange %% is n't waiting for the results of the Chicago exchanges ' cooperation . It recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called ATS\/2 , the automated trading system created by the International Commodities Clearing House . Looking ahead to commodity markets this week :
exchange.n | 5 | Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate . The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies . `` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate %% exchange %% rates . The Treasury expressed pleasure , however , with the government of Taiwan , which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year 's report . The Treasury said Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year .
exchange.n | 3 | The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition . But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 . The bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock %% exchanges %% .
exchange.n | 3 | On Friday , Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia 's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore . The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say . Though the split has long been expected , the %% exchanges %% are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways . The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries . Rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .
exchange.n | 3 | However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve . The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated . These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for %% exchange %% trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance . The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct . Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
exchange.n | 3 | Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry . Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges . Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the %% exchanges %% , the industry and ultimately the general public . One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker . The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
exchange.n | 3 | What if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest exchanges can afford it ? Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets . The U.S. futures %% exchanges %% compete world-wide as never before . Today , trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from U.S. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard . All foreign markets are aggressively courting U.S. business .
exchange.n | 3 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the %% exchanges %% might be closed . He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
exchange.n | 3 | The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle . The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger . Daily trading volume in the New York foreign %% exchange %% market is $ 130 billion . The daily volume for Treasury Securities is about $ 110 billion . The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange , the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion .
exchange.n | 1 | Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` %% exchange %% of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power . But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock .
exchange.n | 3 | The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures . A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other %% exchanges %% has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves . The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
exchange.n | 3 | When the going gets tough , it 's tough to trade stocks in continental Europe . That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence . They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European %% exchanges %% trade stocks . The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on London 's stock exchange , which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries . `` I 'm not saying London covered itself in glory , but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses , '' says Stewart Gilchrist , a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which manages about # 6 billion ( $ 9.63 billion ) in institutional money .
exchange.n | 3 | `` The events strengthen London 's hand in becoming the center for trading European stocks , '' Mr. Gilchrist says . Unable to unload a large block of a French blue-chip company 's shares in Paris for two days last week , a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co. , a London brokerage firm . The firm did the trade in seconds on the London stock %% exchange %% 's SEAQ automated-quotation system . On so-called Manic Monday , Oct. 16 , stock prices plunged across Europe and trading problems erupted . London had some problems , too .
exchange.n | 5 | Your Sept. 25 criticism of credit-card foreign-exchange charges is unwarranted .

Vincent Jolivet Kenmore , Wash .
exchange.n | 3 | If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong . `` The contract is definitely important to the exchange , '' says Robert Gilmore , executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission . Two years ago , the futures %% exchange %% was the envy of other would-be futures centers . After only 17 months , its main contract , based on the Hang Seng index , had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world . { A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date .
exchange.n | 5 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed %% exchange %% rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .
exchange.n | 1 | The leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , which owns 46 % of the common equity of SCI TV , indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15 % , giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring . KKR also signaled to the company 's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights . Holders of SCI TV 's $ 507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in %% exchange %% for taking a 39 % equity stake in SCI TV . They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems . `` I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done , '' says analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here .
exchange.n | 5 | By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union . The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency . It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of %% exchange %% declined . The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency . One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws .
exchange.n | 3 | `` It was the plunge that did n't happen , '' he says . Mr. Breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the California earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress . That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange 's stock options-trading operation , forcing those options to be switched to other %% exchanges %% temporarily . Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing .
exchange.n | 1 | George L. Manzanec , 53 years old , senior vice president of Texas Eastern Corp. , was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern . Mr. Manzanec , who succeeds retiring Richard C. Dixon , will be responsible for gas supply , regulatory affairs , and marketing and transportation and %% exchange %% for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. , Trunkline Gas Co. , Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Algonquin Gas Transmission Co . All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp. , which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year .
exchange.n | 5 | The Soviet State Bank announced a 90 % devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions , in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency . The measure , which will take effect next Wednesday , will create a two-tier %% exchange %% rate . Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar . But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar .

exchange.n | 3 | The New York Stock Exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up . The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio `` basket '' product , the first program-trading vehicle carrying the %% exchange %% 's seal of approval . ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ 5 million . `` Customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available .
exchange.n | 3 | The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago %% exchange %% 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
exchange.n | 3 | The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash . `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it { program trading } , but they { the %% exchange %% } ca n't do it , '' he said . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading . He said the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all the exchange can do is `` slow down the process '' by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers .
exchange.n | 3 | Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock %% exchanges %% late yesterday afternoon at the company 's request , Toronto Stock Exchange officials said . Brian Hemming , a spokesman for the company 's committee of independent directors , established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company , said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning . But Mr. Hemming said he was n't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers .
exchange.n | 3 | For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses . Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a Farmers spokesman said . Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the %% exchanges %% under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which he described as `` peanuts .
exchange.n | 5 | The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , `` as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . '' Overseas sales were stronger , principally because of a rebound in Brazil , where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results , Johnson & Johnson said . Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable %% exchange %% rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter . He cautioned , however , that a `` tough tax-rate comparison '' may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter . For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said .

September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the %% exchange %% began making such figures public in July 1988 . A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever . The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies .

The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors . `` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue %% exchange %% underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence . `` It needs more discipline .

Unease is widespread among %% exchange %% members . `` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 . `` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal .

By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance . The %% exchange %% , he says , must find new products and new markets . That wo n't be an easy task . Tradition is dictator at Lloyd 's .
exchange.n | 3 | Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . The magnitude of the %% exchange %% 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .

But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share %% exchanges %% has grown among European carriers . `` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says . `` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
exchange.n | 5 | In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching %% exchange %% rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions .

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from %% exchange %% agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .

Under guidelines included in an %% exchange %% of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives . The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said .
exchange.n | 5 | Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week . But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday . This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound , economists and foreign %% exchange %% market analysts say . `` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said Chris Dillow , senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute . `` If there is another bad trade number , there could be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted Simon Briscoe , U.K. economist for Midland Montagu , a unit of Midland Bank PLC .
exchange.n | 3 | The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign %% exchange %% market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . Late in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York . The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday .

B.A.T said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today , depending on market conditions , but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22 , when it releases third-quarter results . B.A.T shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on London 's stock %% exchange %% yesterday . Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year 's second half .

exchange.n | 1 | In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department . But there was one bright spot yesterday . The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in %% exchange %% for an ownership stake . The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .

exchange.n | 3 | In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange . The decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake . The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the %% exchange %% could be traded today and tomorrow . SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market . Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .

The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading .
exchange.n | 3 | `` I 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options , because they are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp. , '' said Michael Schwartz , a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co . The SEC reassigned trading in the options , however , to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options . While the %% exchange %% 's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in Los Angeles . Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls . `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said Navin Vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily volume of about 10 million shares .

But Dale Irvine , director of the emergency center , said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas . In Chicago yesterday , Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific %% exchange %% options . The firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange '' even if the exchange is closed , said Wayne Luthringshausen , chairman of Options Clearing .

exchange.n | 1 | That was slightly above Sotheby 's presale estimate of $ 111 million . Normally , Sotheby 's would have earned 20 % of the total in commissions . Instead , people familiar with the transaction said , the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in %% exchange %% for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ 100 million . Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented . Diana D.

exchange.n | 3 | `` While Mr. Reuter 's comments please us very much , there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry , '' a Fiat spokeswoman said . In the interview , Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector , but `` in the long run , I do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars . '' Roberto Morelli , Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London , said that right now `` the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news , '' referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock %% exchanges %% this week .
exchange.n | 3 | For example , in focusing on Mr. Freeman 's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : What if the rumor had been false ? Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false ? In the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock %% exchanges %% were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts . Today , after Mr. Freeman 's plea , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient . In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : ( 1 ) Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and ( 2 ) the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts .
exchange.n | 1 | Mr. Noriega was growing desperate . In late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the U.S. could n't refuse . As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial , Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in %% exchange %% `` for a promise to help clean up Noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the { U.S. . } ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces . '' `` North , '' the document went on , referring to Oliver North , `` has told Noriega 's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions . The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things , just as Noriega had helped { the U.S. . } the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal . ''
exchange.n | 3 | But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade . %% Exchange %% officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed . The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout .
exchange.n | 3 | A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies . `` It was their business decision , '' the official said . Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. %% exchanges %% , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .
exchange.n | 3 | The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity %% exchanges %% , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders . The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems '' associated with the practice . Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers .
exchange.n | 3 | Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders . The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . The %% exchanges %% say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .
exchange.n | 3 | A Merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit . `` It 's too soon to tell ... but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said . He said he would n't comment on the CFTC plan until the %% exchange %% has seen the full proposal . But at a meeting last week , Tom Donovan , the Board of Trade 's president , told commodity lawyers : `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving . It adds something to the market .

Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .

The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America , in everything from phone companies to colas .
exist.v | 1 | Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells %% existed %% , the suit alleged . Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham .

'' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already %% exist %% `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
exist.v | 1 | The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed . As they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never %% existed %% . Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red The Rose , by Stark Young .
exist.v | 1 | In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined . High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision . That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to %% exist %% , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split . Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world . Is there a different reality behind the facade ? ?
exist.v | 1 | Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy . His objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends . That such deficiencies %% existed %% within Ptolemy 's theory was not discovered de novo by Copernicus . The critical , rigorous examinations of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for Nicholas Copernicus ' own work . The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .
exist.v | 1 | He needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion . And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself . He must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not %% exist %% as man . Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' . This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain 's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' .
exist.v | 1 | This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . And the ussr %% existed %% as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations .

explain.v | 1 | One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond . In `` Josephine Baker '' ( Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 ) , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star .

At a nearby corner , they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house , oblivious to any danger .
explain.v | 1 | While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it %% explains %% why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .
explain.v | 1 | This is a mistake . It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy . Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever %% explain %% planetary motion . This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy . So when textbooks , like that of Baker set out drawings of the ' Ptolemaic System ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically .
explain.v | 2 | The picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of American life . The discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others . If our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be %% explained %% by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination . What is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels . Although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise '' , `` individual initiative '' , `` the democratic way '' , `` government of the people '' , `` competition of the marketplace '' , etc. , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen 's confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground '' .
explain.v | 1 | But can one , really ? ? Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson %% explained %% in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago .

According to some who attended , the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending .
express.v | 1 | Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . But for the most part , officials have avoided %% expressing %% those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
express.v | 1 | All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent . Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix , and the California thrift 's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan . Chairman Gonzalez %% expresses %% sympathy for Sen. Riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . `` He 's wise , he 's good and I know he 's an honest man , '' the Texan says . But at the same time , Mr. Gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer .
express.v | 1 | One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can %% express %% themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
express.v | 1 | Then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , Miriam said to the young woman , `` You are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly . You are even uglier than Mr. Wright '' . The animosity %% expressed %% by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ; ; and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art . As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him ; ; she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , the Fighting Liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard . Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' .
express.v | 1 | New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how . Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . They give strict interpretation to William James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to %% express %% itself '' . They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new . Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .
express.v | 1 | Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to %% express %% itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .
express.v | 1 | These are not , however , differences in federal structure . The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles . The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 %% expressed %% , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens . Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789 `` we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America '' . Confederate Constitution , 1861 `` We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America '' .
express.v | 1 | The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children . No one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory . All %% expressed %% interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .
express.v | 1 | Where we end our journey is always the same . We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion '' . This was how Alexander Brandel %% expressed %% pure Zionism . It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it . In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
express.v | 1 | He spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance . Why had I registered ? ? Begging my pardon , he must %% express %% his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall . He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them . Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ? ?
feel.v | 1 | With all this , even the most wary oil men agree something has changed . `` It does n't appear to be getting worse . That in itself has got to cause people to %% feel %% a little more optimistic , '' says Glenn Cox , the president of Phillips Petroleum Co . Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too . The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .
feel.v | 1 | Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are %% feeling %% the squeeze as that work declines . The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation 's largest law firms . While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past .
feel.v | 1 | Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible . The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable . For the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must %% feel %% represented . One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency . As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
feel.v | 3 | `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently . But the nature of the problem is such that many others %% feel %% it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in . We ca n't afford to wait . '' But does it have to be so soon ?
feel.v | 3 | Cadillac may be on to something . Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag . More than 50 % %% felt %% the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal .
feel.v | 1 | The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year . Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers . Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he %% feels %% `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .
feel.v | 1 | He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million . The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . But in general , all foreign-trading companies are %% feeling %% the pinch . `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
feel.v | 1 | Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ? Mr. Goldberg contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view . Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the Israelis %% feel %% put upon . But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant . It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are .
feel.v | 1 | Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . `` They may %% feel %% emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . `` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . '' Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
feel.v | 1 | Meanwhile , the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society . Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs , Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow . He was a `` socialist warrior '' who %% felt %% rankled by West Germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state . Finally , during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago , he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought . But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade , Mr. Gorbachev .
feel.v | 1 | The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they %% felt %% extended to them by the mother country . And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
feel.v | 1 | While the picture was taken , Mr. Miller 's disposition to be generous to Mr. Sandburg increased to the point where he advised , ' I wo n't even charge you the one dollar rental fee ' '' . A knowledgeable celebrity When someone in the audience rose and asked how does it %% feel %% to be a celebrity , Carl said , `` A celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity '' . This has always been Carl 's attitude . Lloyd Lewis wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916 , Sandburg was making $ 27.50 a week writing features for the Day Book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants .
feel.v | 1 | Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one 's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one 's parents ' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger . I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one %% feels %% , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm .
feel.v | 1 | Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' . Under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers . Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can %% feel %% the generalized anger in Wright 's remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole . First , Wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town . But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? ?
feel.v | 1 | 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were %% felt %% with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
feel.v | 3 | In haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings : a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure ; ; a `` Double-Figure '' , which went to the Chicago Art Institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts ; ; and in early 1939 , a `` Fallen Figure '' of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase . `` I knew I was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me '' , he said of the two years ' output in Virginia . With those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he %% felt %% he could stop . They were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art . He had taken out first papers for American citizenship ; ; but after war came to Europe , he decided to return to France , arriving there in January , 1940 .
feel.v | 3 | The most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself . Despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself . Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who %% feel %% themselves to be among the ruling class . Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change . Since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .
feel.v | 1 | This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned %% feels %% a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .
feel.v | 1 | Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe %% felt %% a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago . The New England conscience became desensitized .
feel.v | 1 | The beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present . If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil . He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him %% feel %% truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth . That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in . Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .
feel.v | 3 | Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states . After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union . He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he %% felt %% that necessity left him no other way to save the Union . In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : `` In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' . What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .
feel.v | 1 | The design is determined emotionally : `` I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me '' . Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock . At one time she %% felt %% impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage '' , much as Pollock 's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas . But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself . Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .
feel.v | 1 | Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it . `` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not %% feel %% entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' . With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
feel.v | 1 | This he placed within quick reach . The walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air . Although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly , he %% felt %% no security . Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark ; ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched . Certain this menace was only imaginary , he yet stared in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon .
feel.v | 1 | Scotty was neutral . He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . He ate what he %% felt %% like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . His energy was gone . He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving .
feel.v | 3 | He was not irritated . He did not mind the useless , kindly questions . He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; ; he %% felt %% he was noting it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger . Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son 's illness . `` Have you got enough blankets '' ? ?
feel.v | 2 | Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we could n't get in ? ? Suppose I had n't brought along enough money ? ? I %% felt %% for my wallet . Its thick , substantial outline calmed me . But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong .
feel.v | 2 | But he was too busy to hear what she was saying . So they parted when she was in an impatient humor . When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , %% feeling %% in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window . Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' . He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen .
feel.v | 3 | He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house . That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it . I always %% felt %% the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs . Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .
feel.v | 1 | They 've never met , you know . But Myra would n't budge without an express invitation . I %% feel %% kind of bad about it '' . He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt . `` I imagine the old girl has n't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road .
feel.v | 1 | Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He %% felt %% a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
feel.v | 1 | I 'm not a plaster saint . Waking up was horrible . Never in my life have I %% felt %% so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife . We both had hangovers . Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow .
feel.v | 1 | And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street . I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship . I %% felt %% it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later . What I did know was that Precious was always around . He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .
feel.v | 1 | He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King 's Bridge toward Westchester . The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck ' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass . The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David 's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and %% felt %% again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston . Pensive , introspective , he ached . He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .
feel.v | 3 | Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school . He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry . Kate %% felt %% she had deserted the boy in her own loss . She loved him and missed his company . Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .
feel.v | 1 | Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; ; her son was dead . Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross . In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus %% felt %% for his mother ; ; only what Mary felt for her son . Jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eyes closed . Mary would have to carry the human communication .
feel.v | 2 | He felt them . They were damp . He reached out and %% felt %% the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub . Damp also . He looked around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick '' ? ?
feel.v | 1 | He thought of Simms Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him . He thought of Simms Purdew rising up , fearless in glory . He %% felt %% the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh . Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . They did not know who they were or know their own worth .
feel.v | 1 | We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . Whatever we %% felt %% about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming . The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .
feel.v | 3 | Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts . While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road . It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we %% felt %% that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one . Mattathias Dover said : `` It makes sense . If we cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' .
feel.v | 1 | Remember that He heard himself haranguing them . He saw himself before them delivering the speech . He laughed , suddenly , %% feeling %% a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention . One day , Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work '' . He would ! !
feel.v | 1 | Give um the works . See , he 's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk . Coughlin grinned , %% feeling %% supremely on top of things . He watched the snow once again . It infuriated him .
feel.v | 1 | He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . Still , the sensation always surprised him . It was a thrill he %% felt %% no part in . He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things . He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
feel.v | 1 | He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice `` Hal Yarrow '' ! ! Said the whining voice . And , slowly , %% feeling %% himself icy yet burning , Hal turned . There was the squat loose-jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him . `` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice .
feel.v | 1 | Hello , Mike . My , you look chipper '' . `` I %% feel %% fine ! ! Where is everybody '' ? ? `` Asleep .
feel.v | 1 | If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it . Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig in . The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you 'll %% feel %% angelic . Get Happy , junior '' ! ! Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .
feel.v | 1 | This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh -- a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . Mercer got the blissful needle . When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he %% felt %% the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body . He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
feel.v | 3 | Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ? `` It 's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said . `` We regard it as fair only when each party %% feels %% that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' . His heart , he discovered , was pounding . `` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
feel.v | 1 | Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock . He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide . It was the only thing in his life for which he %% felt %% guilt . Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see . Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
feel.v | 1 | But all of this was rationalization . Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep . His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he %% felt %% as if he had nothing . The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that would n't allow it . The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work .
feel.v | 1 | Such a pitiful end '' ! ! Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded . The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't %% feel %% privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady . Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives . So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .
feel.v | 1 | Early that day Matsuo saw a marine . The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery . As his feet slowed , he %% felt %% ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand . He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed . In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .
feel.v | 1 | `` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us . He looked as if he was going to keel over . I %% felt %% a queasiness in my own stomach but it would n't do to show these girls that we were afraid . Not so soon , anyway . I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .
feel.v | 3 | Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired . As it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something clicks . Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I %% felt %% that she knew it , for we both kept our distance . When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it . And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously .
feel.v | 1 | He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg %% felt %% himself developing a case of claustrophobia . The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in . If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
feel.v | 1 | A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot . A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away . A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he %% felt %% a brief burn on his upper arm . Another snarled close overhead . `` Jumping Jerusalem ! !
feel.v | 1 | By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them . No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal . Even strange names seemed to make them %% feel %% closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness . Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .
feel.v | 1 | `` Ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? ? `` This ai n't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested . `` Or maybe you just do n't %% feel %% like a cigar '' ? ? `` I feel like getting back to town , that 's what I feel like ! ! Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed . Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ? Pamela %% felt %% calm and peaceful as she walked along . The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear . She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
feel.v | 3 | But it was not easy for him and he often slipped . When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced . I %% felt %% certain he was really a spineless little man . His hat ( the cause of his baldness ? ? ) hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it I could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck . The morning 's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men 's magazines .
feel.v | 1 | It sprang from a type of mentality I 'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here . I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed . I %% felt %% strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance . I lived in a state of suspense because of it . I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to .
feel.v | 1 | Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles . It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know . Mama was vulnerable ; ; one had always %% felt %% the need to make a safe world around her . But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta . She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
feel.v | 1 | On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age . %% Feeling %% suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human . Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
feel.v | 1 | The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources . The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies . There were n't facilities to take care of them ; ; there never had been a need %% felt %% for such facilities . That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates . The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .
feel.v | 3 | Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers . Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . He %% felt %% that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor . Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts . Sooner or later , Dolores would crack .
feel.v | 1 | `` All right . But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' . Anne laughed and Cady %% felt %% the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck . `` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said . `` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college .
feel.v | 1 | I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance . It was no use . I %% felt %% myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .
feel.v | 1 | Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman . Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy . She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people %% feel %% sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own . He did n't know what was so tough about Vivian 's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name . Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ?
feel.v | 3 | She got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick . Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and %% felt %% themselves to be so . Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits . `` No '' , said Theresa .
feel.v | 1 | That 's what was on my mind . I was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off . I %% felt %% better Tuesday evening when I woke up . My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others . A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .
feel.v | 1 | I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night 's melancholy . My head was clear . I was hungry as a wolf , and my body %% felt %% lean and vital . `` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .
feel.v | 1 | We 'd keep her a day or two , and the AA people would talk to her . But if she was n't interested , she 'd just go back to the same life she 'd left . Turning toward the patient again , I -- I ca n't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I %% felt %% sick . I tell you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak . `` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft '' ? ?
feel.v | 3 | Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile . Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one . He was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people %% felt %% , because they knew that money must be a problem to him . But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company . The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary .
feel.v | 3 | `` I think we 're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive . `` Now , I believe Poor John 'll work just a little harder . With that wife of his , I think he %% feels %% every chance he gets is his big chance . Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities . And also , the money ca n't mean as much to Bobbie .
feel.v | 1 | She stood , once more listening . She had never been here at this hour . She %% felt %% as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her . If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .
feel.v | 1 | Please , you just go ahead '' . She had disappeared . He could %% feel %% a pulse pounding against the bandages . He imagined Sam 's voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? ? I would n't have the strength to answer , he thought .
feel.v | 1 | I will simply kill you first . Now go '' ! ! The other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger %% felt %% . They picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl . The sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs .
feel.v | 1 | `` I 'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him . `` Oh , I 'd drink with newspaper people . I think I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really %% felt %% alive . But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .
feel.v | 1 | If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . I love you , I hate you , I %% feel %% like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you 're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . So I went about my business . I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
feel.v | 1 | It was coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see me since . But suppose she had not taken Mrs. Mathias ' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , dispossessed of love , hanging on to makeshifts , and altogether and finally arid . If she chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her fullest height , and transcending her murky self , %% felt %% at last the passion of a great moral decision ? ? If they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions . Yes , I had cried out that I knew she 'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt .
feel.v | 1 | The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't %% feel %% lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . In a way , Askington was right .
feel.v | 1 | And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart . You feel him every mile further away . You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you %% feel %% when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she did n't particularly give a damn whether she got him or did n't . And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he could n't afford and the too-shiny shoes . You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? ?
feel.v | 1 | It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing . He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day . So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , %% feeling %% . If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever . You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .
feel.v | 1 | One did one 's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward . One did one 's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one 's ship . And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he %% felt %% no shame . God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist 's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career . Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .
feel.v | 1 | She sighed a dirty word and left . Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance . She sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen %% felt %% sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support . A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde 's place . He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .
feel.v | 1 | Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy slang . `` Take off , fly-boy '' ! ! `` Uh -- sorry '' ! ! He muttered , and took off , obviously %% feeling %% like a fool . The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy . She felt like a fool , too .
feel.v | 1 | He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again . Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank . Mr. Robards laughed , said he 'd %% feel %% a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her . `` You could try . And if I ever hear you say ' Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .
find.v | 1 | That is for the future . Already , scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that , for the first time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer . `` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says Bert Vogelstein , a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just %% found %% a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer . `` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level . Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ''
find.v | 1 | Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible . Dr. Knudson %% found %% that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer .
find.v | 1 | Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene . When they found it last winter , Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over . His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had %% found %% in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones . The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 . But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth .
find.v | 1 | The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass . Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have %% found %% that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies . The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer . The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
find.v | 1 | Until the tanker spill , Big Oil was slowly convincing authorities it could safely produce from such places . Now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for years . Similarly , a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil %% found %% off the California coast in the early 1980s . A huge production system built in the sea off Santa Barbara and ashore is sitting idle . But the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas .
find.v | 1 | One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work . Kadane Oil Co. , a small Texas independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others . One of its wells , in southwestern Oklahoma , is a `` rank wildcat , '' a risky well where oil previously has n't been %% found %% . `` At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good , '' says George Kadane , head of the company . `` If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years .

find.v | 1 | They also wanted to prevent a NATO training base being built in the region , he said . The action , in the Canadian Federal Court , will be against Canada , the Netherlands , West Germany , Britain and the U.S. , the ministry spokesman said . Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after %% finding %% some contaminated by radiation , an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said . Japan has been testing imported food from Europe since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union , the spokesman said . Since then , the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from European countries , including Italy , Spain , Turkey , Greece and the Soviet Union .
find.v | 1 | The session failed to enact any new curbs . Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape . Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration %% finds %% itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
find.v | 1 | Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up . `` As we 've seen in the '80s , '' says Roger Werner , the president of the ESPN sports channel , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work . And three years later , in a sea of red ink , the heroes can %% find %% themselves with a lot of explaining to do . '' CBS pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges Thomas H. Wyman , who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9 % stake in the company and took over three years ago . `` They lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one .
find.v | 1 | Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it %% found %% no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending . The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited .
find.v | 1 | The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other . Ms. Bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem . Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never %% find %% a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna . Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended . Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse .

find.v | 1 | In this connection , it is important to note that several members of New York 's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black , Hispanic , and non-Hispanic white populations -- Carolyn Maloney 's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter 's 25th district in Brooklyn , for example . To win their seats on the council , these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all . Often they have %% found %% that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education . Birmingham , Ala. : The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities .
find.v | 1 | The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , says Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner . And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time . %% Finding %% pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .

find.v | 1 | Mr. von Germeten , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a `` witch hunt . '' Mr. Kriz of Moody 's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year . The company 's current management %% found %% itself `` locked into this , '' he said .
find.v | 3 | It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more . It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes . It is also the kind of libel politicians %% find %% useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency . But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
find.v | 1 | But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded . No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently %% found %% very good ones . After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
find.v | 1 | They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to %% find %% alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan .
find.v | 1 | The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books . Litigation Sciences does n't make moral distinctions . If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help %% find %% them . As Mr. Vinson explains it , `` We do n't control the facts .

find.v | 1 | `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added . `` Magazines could , like other brands , %% find %% that they have only a limited life . '' There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling . More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .
find.v | 1 | Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % . China 's People 's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud .

find.v | 5 | The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .

Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . '' Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found .

find.v | 1 | More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds , such as a $ 100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year . Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months . A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator , Mr. Fazio nonetheless %% found %% himself burdened not only by California 's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel . The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $ 100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina . California 's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position , too .

Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .

While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom . In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
find.v | 1 | The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges . Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire ( $ 880,000 ) from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman %% found %% hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse . Banco Ambrosiano , which was Italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts .

By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been %% found %% with their mistresses . This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967 , when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent .

And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more . It forced us to %% fix %% the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed . The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President 's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem . Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .

Moore , director of research at Argus Research Corp . Traders and analysts alike said the market 's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage . Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading , designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index %% futures %% . `` People are looking for an ability to try and read the market , rather than be manipulated , '' said Dudley A.

Merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading , including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial %% futures %% . Merrill , in a statement by Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully , said index arbitrage `` has been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility , '' so Merrill wo n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place . In stock-index arbitrage , traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options .
future.n | 4 | When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later , some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy . Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed . If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his %% future %% , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika .

Municipal Issues The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the New York City sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond %% futures %% continued to grow more negative . The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand . December municipal futures ended up 11\/32 point to 92-14 , having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded .

The Big Board ca n't ban stock-index %% futures %% , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off .

future.n | 3 | Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds , which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades , will continue to launch big programs through the stock market . Wells Fargo Investment Advisers , Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street , trading executives say . These huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes , and frequently swap between stocks and %% futures %% to capture profits . `` They will do it every chance they get , '' said one program-trading executive . Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say .
future.n | 3 | Separately , Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security . Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for %% futures %% than for stocks . Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility . These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .
future.n | 3 | These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line . Stock-index arbitrage , because it sells the more `` expensive '' market and buys the `` cheaper '' one , attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets , and the adjustments are often abrupt . But unequal trading rules allow the %% futures %% market to trade differently from stocks , which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place . `` There has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis , '' said Christopher Pedersen , director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp . `` One agency should have the authority over all equity products .

future.n | 1 | To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion . It is known in the Pentagon as the `` negative wedge . '' The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ 22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ 23 billion in an `` above guidance '' management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the %% future %% . The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7 % by 1994 . Most forecasters , including those in the Congressional Budget Office , assume inflation will be in excess of 4 % in each of those five years .
future.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil %% futures %% marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the exchange falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange .
future.n | 3 | `` Our members are eager to begin trading this contract , so we expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural gas pit , '' he said . The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two , he added . The Merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil , gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest %% futures %% exchange in New York , and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . In a recent interview , Mr. Thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image . Earlier this year , the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago exchanges .

For example , the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC .
future.n | 3 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. %% futures %% markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve . The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated .
future.n | 3 | The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. %% futures %% exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision . Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are . The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
future.n | 3 | He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash . `` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. Brady said . Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a %% futures %% contract . Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000 a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 .
future.n | 3 | The Fed also has the power to set margin requirements . But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ? Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the %% futures %% market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle . The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .

future.n | 3 | The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures . A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index %% futures %% rivals that in the stocks themselves . The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
future.n | 3 | Warren Buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982 . And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if %% futures %% cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done . And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . '' Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps .
future.n | 3 | Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital . `` Before %% futures %% , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . '' While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks . When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows .
future.n | 3 | On Tuesday , for instance , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 80 points in little more than an hour . Then , in the space of a 20-minute coffee break , the average rallied almost all of the way back . Paul Lesutis , who manages more than $ 3 billion of investments at Provident Capital Management Inc. , blames %% futures %% markets for leading the way . `` The fundamentals do n't change in an hour , '' he says . `` I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing . ''
future.n | 3 | It 's too disruptive , '' he says . `` It is n't investing . '' But stock-index %% futures %% have plenty of support . Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
future.n | 3 | They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures . And , defenders say , few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising . Louis Margolis , managing director in charge of equity options and %% futures %% at Salomon Inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures . Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs . He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . ''
future.n | 3 | Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs . He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . '' Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the %% futures %% and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says . Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says Andrew Yemma , a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which trades the S&P 500 , by far the largest stock-index futures contract . Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear .

Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear . For one thing , the Chicago %% futures %% exchanges have political and financial clout -- including many friends in Congress . And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape . `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader .
future.n | 3 | `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader . `` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo . '' Average daily volume in S&P 500 %% futures %% last year was 44,877 contracts . Based on yesterday 's closing price of the S&P , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ 7.6 billion . By contrast , average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $ 5.3 billion .

If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts . And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions .

And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on %% futures %% as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions . One reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down . Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 % .
future.n | 3 | `` That gives futures traders a lot more power . '' By contrast , an investor in stocks must put up 50 % in cash . Some critics say %% futures %% encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather than as investments in individual businesses . Thus , they say , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most . The S&P 500 index futures `` transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit - making them a simple commodity to trade , '' says George Kegler , senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia .
future.n | 3 | The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . But owning index %% futures %% is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
future.n | 3 | Hong Kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time . The contract was first proposed more than two years ago , but shortly afterward , the colony 's markets were hit hard by the October 1987 global stock crash . The subsequent drive to reform Hong Kong 's markets also has embroiled the interest-rate %% futures %% contract . The Securities and Futures Commission , a government watchdog set up after the 1987 crash to try to restore confidence and order to Hong Kong 's markets , had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week . But regulators this week said futures-exchange officials still have a way to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract .
future.n | 3 | If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong . `` The contract is definitely important to the exchange , '' says Robert Gilmore , executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission . Two years ago , the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be %% futures %% centers . After only 17 months , its main contract , based on the Hang Seng index , had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world . { A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date .
future.n | 3 | But in the week following the 1987 stock crash , the exchange verged on collapse , and the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong were closed for four days . Only a government-sponsored bailout kept the crisis from swallowing the exchange . Trading in Hang Seng index %% futures %% remains crippled by the experience . Volume for the entire month of September totaled only 21,687 contracts , compared with a daily average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987 crash . Despite the thin trading , and after two painful years of restructuring , the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests .
future.n | 3 | Despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is likely to start slowly . The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled . Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its %% futures %% market . And Mr. Gilmore cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency . He says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day .
future.n | 1 | Black & Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to Orkem S.A. , a French chemical company , for $ 345 million . Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year . Black & Decker said it plans to put other Emhart units on the block in the %% future %% , with the goal of raising $ 1 billion in net proceeds . Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load .
future.n | 1 | Even the biggest auto shows in the U.S. are largely regional affairs , but the Tokyo show is international . Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up . Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives , including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked to see the %% future %% . Even the Soviet Union came , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model . Here 's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw .
future.n | 3 | Dow Jones industrials 2653.28 , off 5.94 ; transportation 1199.32 , off 11.38 ; utilities 216.49 , up 1.45 .

Dollar : 141.52 yen , up 0.07 ; 1.8353 marks , off 0.0002 .
future.n | 3 | Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength . A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices . Wheat %% futures %% prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis . Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment . As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .

As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago . Soybean %% futures %% for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel to close at $ 5.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade . December corn futures added 2.25 cents a bushel to close at $ 2.4225 a bushel on the Board of Trade . Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices .
future.n | 3 | The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month , and is expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said . COTTON : %% Futures %% prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy . The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents . Several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical .
future.n | 1 | Previously , Columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments . Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices . For its %% future %% strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities . The quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California . Thomas Spiegel , Columbia 's chairman , said in a statement that the thrift was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes .
future.n | 4 | The group , which has held half a dozen seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers . `` People in this business have been insulated , '' says Josh Pons , a horse breeder from Bel Air , Md . `` But the real %% future %% of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses . '' At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch .
future.n | 4 | Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands . Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy . American education 's %% future %% will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share . The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way . The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
future.n | 3 | Dow Jones industrials 2659.22 , off 3.69 ; transportation 1210.70 , off 25.96 ; utilities 215.04 , off 0.31 . Bonds : Shearson Lehman Hutton Treasury index 3425.22 , up Commodities : Dow Jones %% futures %% index 129.24 , off 0.25 ; spot index 130.76 , off 0.88 . Dollar : 141.45 yen , off 0.45 ; 1.8355 marks , off 0.0115 .
future.n | 3 | That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the Big Board . But at a critical moment , stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control . They scooped up hundreds of S&P %% futures %% when the market needed it most . At about 10:40 a.m. EDT , several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks . `` It is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected , '' said one Chicago-based futures trader .
future.n | 3 | `` There was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P %% futures %% in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath . Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index . The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 3 | All 20-stocks in the MMI except Exxon , General Motors and Sears were down $ 1 to $ 2 . At 10:33 , when the S&P 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs , S&P futures trading was halted and program trades on the Big Board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances . Under the rules adopted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase %% futures %% . At this point , the Dow industrials were down 75.41 points and falling . The trading halt in the S&P 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many traders maintain .
future.n | 3 | `` It was whooosh ! '' said one futures trader . In five minutes , the Dow industrials climbed almost 30 points . The big %% futures %% buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the Dow 's loss to 31 points by 11 a.m . Traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders . These firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit .
future.n | 3 | Traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders . These firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit . Then they completed the other side of the trade by buying %% futures %% , which abruptly halted the stock market 's decline as traders began to buy stocks . From then on , the Dow industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points . Then , in late-afternoon trading , hundred-thousand-share buy orders for UAL hit the market , including a 200,000-share order through Bear Stearns that seemed to spark UAL 's late price surge .
future.n | 3 | In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market . In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil %% futures %% yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a barrel for December delivery . Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking .
future.n | 3 | As for other export customers , the Soviet Union is n't expected to be back buying U.S. corn in significant amounts until early next year , he said . A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March , indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter . COCOA : %% Futures %% at first continued the rally begun on Monday , but then faltered and closed lower . The December contract opened just under Monday 's close , triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ 1,030 a metric ton , pushing the price to $ 1,040 , and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests . The contract settled at $ 1,014 a ton , off $ 13 .
future.n | 3 | Dow Jones industrials 2662.91 , off 26.23 ; transportation 1236.66 , up 5.86 ; utilities 215.35 , off 0.13 . Bonds : Shearson Lehman Hutton Treasury index 3411.08 , up Commodities : Dow Jones %% futures %% index 129.49 , off 0.13 ; spot index 131.64 , up 0.30 . Dollar : 141.90 yen , off 0.53 ; 1.8470 marks , off 0.0108 .
future.n | 3 | Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said . There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on %% futures %% prices . For instance , one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ 20 a barrel . `` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said .
future.n | 3 | Friday 's Market Activity Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading . Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks . But there were fewer price swings than expected . Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange .
future.n | 1 | `` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . `` Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable %% future %% . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
future.n | 3 | `` It 's traders squaring positions . It 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . '' Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices . The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday . The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 3 | Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle %% futures %% contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots . After the close of trading Friday , the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 , down 6 % from that date a year earlier . Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
future.n | 1 | Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable %% future %% . '' However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
future.n | 3 | But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates . '' But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market . Investors also are anxious about today 's `` witching hour , '' the monthly expiration of stock-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks . This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session . In major market activity : Stock prices surged in heavy trading .
future.n | 3 | That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn . By some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn . By buying %% futures %% contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver . Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts . Among other things , the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .
future.n | 3 | `` Putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight , '' he said . COPPER : %% Futures %% prices recovered in quiet trading . The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to $ 1.2795 . That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week , mostly in reaction to last Friday 's stock market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper , a leading industrial metal .
future.n | 1 | This ballpark , the Stick , was not a classic baseball stadium -- too symmetrical , too much bald concrete . And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium . But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the %% future %% , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history . The broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
future.n | 3 | They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . %% Futures %% and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . `` There is n't a boatload { of big investors } out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services .
future.n | 3 | `` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds . `` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses %% futures %% in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says .
future.n | 4 | Construction of the 34-floor building will begin next May and should be completed in April 1992 . Units will cost from 500,000 to 3.5 million Australian dollars ( about US$ 386,000 to US$ 2.7 million ) . The Soviet Union has halted construction of two Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors and is reassessing the %% future %% of 12 other existing reactors . Viktor Sidorenko , vice chairman of the State Committee on Nuclear Safety , said the two reactors were at Kursk and Smolensk . News of the halt comes amid growing anger in the Ukraine and Byelorussia over continuing high levels of radiation from Chernobyl .
future.n | 3 | The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 . Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index %% futures %% and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
future.n | 3 | Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading , one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record . Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report , they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium . On Friday , the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor 's 500 %% futures %% contract -- a `` circuit breaker '' procedure instituted after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time . Futures trading resumed a half-hour later , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs , traders said . By Monday morning , they said , stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped re-establish the link between stocks and futures .
future.n | 3 | The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday . The CBOE , American Stock Exchange , Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett , owner of Fossett , joined in putting up $ 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options . The head of another small options clearing firm , who asked not to be identified , said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and %% futures %% business . Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s , most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next . Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms .
future.n | 1 | The Postels did not give permission . But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway , only to be captured `` in flagrante '' by Joan Postel , who called the police . Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $ 1 million garage in Paris , the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any %% future %% hoisting of trees , and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $ 35 million lawsuit . Nothing less , it seemed , could console them for their traumas . Where had all the money come from ?
future.n | 1 | But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts . `` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said . `` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the %% future %% and that means rate increases . '' Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed . Safeco fell 1\/8 to 32 5\/8 on 462,900 shares .
future.n | 3 | The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it 's meaningless . One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather . The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping %% futures %% prices firm . That country recently bought 200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n't . `` It 's known they need the sugar , and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support , '' the dealer said .
future.n | 4 | The stock tumbled 24 7\/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares . The market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers . UAL , which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks would n't finance , represents the %% future %% of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market - corporate restructuring . An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds , used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks . `` It was a very nervous day , '' said John Geary , partner of the Big Board specialist firm Ziebarth , Geary .
future.n | 3 | And , apparently , it is here to stay . Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co , says , `` My gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while . '' There are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such as stock-index %% futures %% and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology . But most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly . Prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert .
future.n | 3 | But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets . Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and %% futures %% . Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets .
future.n | 4 | But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels . And the administration 's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month , though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February . Most analysts think there 's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms , and after the February election their %% future %% in any form will be murky at best . Instead of focusing on the Contras , Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government . The administration continues to support SDI , or Star Wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program .
future.n | 3 | The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said . LIVESTOCK AND MEATS : The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly %% futures %% contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork . The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday . Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef .
future.n | 3 | Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging . Since Sept. 1 , about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year . Corn %% futures %% prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed .
future.n | 3 | After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index %% futures %% pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .
future.n | 3 | For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market . Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago . Since the crash , many %% futures %% traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them . More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell . Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
future.n | 3 | They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss . The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses . Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index %% futures %% . But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade .
future.n | 1 | He said Hydro-Quebec already has some `` customers in mind '' for the power that was to be delivered to Maine . `` Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 , '' said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly . Central Maine said it is evaluating `` many energy options '' to make up for the lost %% future %% power , including new energy generation and management proposals from New England , and possibly new Canadian purchases .
go.v | 7 | Greece and Turkey , for example , are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other . Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals . `` It 's just %% going %% to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs { the Warsaw Pact 's } , '' says one NATO analyst . So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed . They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude .
go.v | 7 | But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves . If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products . `` It 's %% going %% to be a sensational thing , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay . Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel : `` I just got back yesterday from the U.S. . In the newspapers , on the radio and TV , psyllium is everywhere . ''
go.v | 10 | `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he says . Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem %% goes %% beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power .
go.v | 1 | `` Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells , '' says foreman Tommy Folsom . Santa Fe aims to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year . It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it %% went %% looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter . `` We went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect , '' says Tim Parker , a Santa Fe exploration manager . `` Five were interested . ''
go.v | 7 | He got three trucks and a backhoe cheap . `` I want to add one more truck , '' Mr. Huber says . I sense that it 's %% going %% to continue to grow . That 's the word . The word is out .
go.v | 7 | Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic . `` There will be no capital-gains bill this year , '' said Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) . `` I 'm probably not %% going %% to vote for any capital-gains proposal . The IRA portion ( of the Packwood-Roth plan ) is irresponsible . '' Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell .
go.v | 1 | It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to %% go %% into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) .
go.v | 1 | Well , CBS , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid . But Mr. Pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid . `` The price of poker has %% gone %% up , '' crows Charles M. Neinas , the College Football Association 's executive director . With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $ 2.5 billion for four years of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business . CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong .
go.v | 2 | No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . `` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner says . `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're %% gone %% . '' During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks . Last October , during the 1988 Summer Games , NBC relentlessly pitched a new series , `` Tattingers . ''
go.v | 1 | Mrs. Thatcher : `` If it 's one against 48 , I 'm very sorry for the 48 . '' If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is Britain 's mysteriously intractable inflation problem . We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by %% going %% along . It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs . Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain 's voters will decide who is right about Europe , sanctioning South Africa or running Britain 's economy .
go.v | 7 | `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia . The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's %% going %% to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders .
go.v | 1 | But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet . `` It 's a big-risk business , '' warns Charles C. Mihalek , a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner . `` You have to %% go %% into it firmly believing that it 's the kind of investment where you can lose everything . '' And many have done just that . Consider Spendthrift Farm , a prominent Lexington horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year .
go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
go.v | 1 | Closer to home , the negotiators were more generous . An estimated $ 38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner , the House chairman . And $ 70.2 million would %% go %% to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat , Sen. James Sasser . Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska , Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process . Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd ( D. , W.Va . ) even added report language listing $ 49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year .
go.v | 14 | Felix Siemienas is destroying it now . He packs pork . A law %% went %% on the books in January that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs . He cashed in . Poland is short on enterprises , not enterprise .
go.v | 1 | Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences . `` In the past , people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said . `` Now you %% go %% to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests . A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they said .
go.v | 7 | `` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn . `` But I 'm going to lose $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 on it . I 'm %% going %% to have to get another job this year just to eat . '' Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs . Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer .
go.v | 1 | `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago , '' says Charles Shaw , a Chicago-based real estate developer . `` So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties . They 'll %% go %% into someone else 's pasture as long as it 's greener than the one they 're in now . '' Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects . The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market .
go.v | 11 | In July unfilled orders grew 1 % . But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . `` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us %% going %% . That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said . `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . ''
go.v | 10 | Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . `` This particular issue %% goes %% to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . '' Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
go.v | 1 | Garry Kasparov %% went %% to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack .
go.v | 2 | IN LOS ANGELES , more small businesses ponder adopting a child-care policy . Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees . The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often %% go %% to the smaller concerns . Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide . Council member Joy Picus , the measure 's chief advocate , considers it part of a `` pro-family policy '' that makes Los Angeles a leader in `` humanizing the workplace . ''
go.v | 7 | They 're in the midst of a turnaround , '' she noted . Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year . A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is %% going %% to have people coming and going . '' Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 . Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp .
go.v | 1 | Ironically , American Airlines ' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry ( Sept. 20 ) . You quote Robert Crandall , chairman of American 's parent , AMR Corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to Detroit because you have to %% go %% to Detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . '' Even if Mr. Crandall is correct , he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level . In 1986 , he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff 's president that they both raise fares 20 % .
go.v | 14 | Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses . For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions . Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank %% goes %% about development , financial markets have confidence in it . This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms . Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
go.v | 1 | `` My style is less informal , '' Mr. Brawer says . Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership . `` You ca n't %% go %% anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights . `` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. Brawer says . `` You can think long range . ''
go.v | 2 | They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . '' Indeed , the stakes are high . The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to %% go %% for related products . HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .
go.v | 14 | The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $ 3 billion in junk financing . Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale . At that point , the junk market %% went %% into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell . In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk . `` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says .
go.v | 7 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're %% going %% to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
go.v | 1 | `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously . `` Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on %% going %% . '' Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties . In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal , for example , Rep. Thomas Lantos , the California Democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato , a New York Republican .
go.v | 1 | The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $ 1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds . By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and his party 's largest state delegation in the House . `` I have no regrets about %% going %% forward , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio ( D. , Calif. ) , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting . `` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . '' The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
go.v | 1 | The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai deux amours '' they wept . Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II . In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' %% goes %% on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested . It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want . One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . ''
go.v | 14 | `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . `` On the other hand , we have economic news that is { expected to be } relatively positive for the bond market . We will %% go %% back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
go.v | 14 | Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator . The subject of the movie `` Lean on Me , '' Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat . He may have %% gone %% overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ? Elena Scambio , the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state , says her top priority will be to `` cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy . '' Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters .
go.v | 7 | The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m . CNBC is available to 13 million cable households . Mr. Downey said he is not %% going %% to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . `` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . I 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home .
go.v | 4 | With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service . If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know . What %% went %% wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry . Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity . But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
go.v | 1 | David Baltimore , who has just been named president of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to %% go %% through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name . The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .
go.v | 1 | But once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data . `` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said Samuel Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc . `` If one thinks that rates are %% going %% down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . '' Friday 's Market Activity Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
go.v | 7 | `` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco . `` It 's like kicking the tires of a car ... . What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car %% going %% to perform ? '' General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended Thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . But Lipper Analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations .
go.v | 1 | Out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions . `` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said Barbara May . She %% went %% first for personal mementos . In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . '' After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded .
go.v | 1 | But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing . `` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . `` Cathay would love to keep %% going %% , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
go.v | 14 | Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand . It is a certainty that Mr. Barre 's days are numbered . The U.S. should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not %% go %% down with him . Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be . But as one expert tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than Barre . ''
go.v | 1 | But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires . It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it . Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will %% go %% up sharply because you 're that much older . So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .
go.v | 1 | He says he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . ) For some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived . `` The trappings of success %% go %% a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . `` People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says .
go.v | 7 | Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? `` You 're not %% going %% to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
go.v | 1 | Indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room . But , says Mr. Katz , the U.S. attorney , `` the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings . When we %% go %% there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
go.v | 14 | In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way . Using it , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner ? Other cases %% go %% to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner . Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
go.v | 14 | So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on . Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . %% Go %% with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations . `` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
go.v | 14 | The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . Franchisees ca n't be forced to %% go %% along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
go.v | 1 | Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy . But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat . The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy %% going %% in , they reported . Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod . As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .

I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . Those enterprises , however , are not %% going %% to be privatized . They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . ''
go.v | 14 | Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing . At the scheduled time , Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked . After the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` %% Go %% ahead and tell us what happened . We may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . '' No lawyers or tape recorders were present .
go.v | 1 | Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . Smith-Kline Beecham %% goes %% further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .
go.v | 1 | Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion . Mr. Briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3 billion current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions . Nevertheless , he noted , `` No one will want to %% go %% into the trade figures without a flat position '' in the pound . Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded . In his Mansion House speech , Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect .
go.v | 1 | Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees . Conservatives now hold only a 5-4 edge . One slot is expected to %% go %% to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas , a black conservative ; after mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against him . Other conservatives thought to be on the administration 's short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann , who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department , and Marshall Breger , chairman of a U.S. agency on administration . The Bush administration would also like to nominate a woman ; one possibility is former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing .
go.v | 7 | The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward . After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . `` If you 're %% going %% to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? '' Mr. Courter , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago . Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor .
go.v | 4 | `` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . He is sitting in his living room , beneath a huge portrait of his late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 . Somewhere , the son sighs , things %% went %% terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation . `` People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it . But my father meant it to mean real separation , '' says the son .
go.v | 10 | `` Mastergate '' is subtitled `` a play on words , '' and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone . He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a `` meteoric disappearance '' and found himself `` handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs . '' This interest in words %% goes %% beyond puns and playfulness , however . Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation , the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides . As the hearings begin , the self-important Sen. Bowman ( Jerome Kilty ) announces : `` Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset : We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape . ''
go.v | 1 | `` Unfortunately , '' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . '' The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death . `` I think if we had been allowed to %% go %% ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. Sanford says . `` If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him .

go.v | 1 | Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran . When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine . Mr. Carter said he would %% go %% to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran . But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots . So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force .
go.v | 2 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon %% went %% away , while the shah -- he kept coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
grant.v | 1 | Federal health officials are expected today to approve a program %% granting %% long-deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan , secretary of Health and Human Services . The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease .
grant.v | 1 | A federal judge %% granted %% a temporary stay of the California Student Aid Commission 's emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for National Technical Schools , a unit of United Education & Software Inc . The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards , and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations . United Education & Software , a Los Angeles education services company , called the commission 's action `` precipitous and unwarranted . ''
grant.v | 2 | No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met . Almost from that day , until his death , Olgivanna was to stay at his side ; ; but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady . It must be %% granted %% that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval . Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe . Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .
grant.v | 2 | When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I %% grant %% , has a definite place in our society . But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .

It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not %% granted %% . Anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors . There was nothing wrong with her job .
hold.v | 8 | A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said . The blast , which wrecked the opposition labor group 's offices , was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador 's 10-year-old civil war . Hungary 's Parliament voted to %% hold %% a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president . The balloting to decide when and how to fill the position , which replaces a collective presidency under a pact signed by the ruling Socialists and opposition groups , is to be held Nov . The State Department denied asylum to a Vietnamese man who escaped from his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder housing of a tanker for two days in monsoon seas .
hold.v | 5 | Spain 's Socialist Party claimed victory in nationwide elections , saying it had retained its parliamentary majority by one seat . With all the votes counted , a government spokesman said Prime Minister Gonzalez 's party won 176 seats in the 350-seat Cortes , or lower house of parliament . The Socialists %% held %% 184 seats going into the balloting . Thousands of East Germans attended public rallies organized by the Communist leadership and demanded free speech , controls on the security forces and an end to official privileges . The gatherings in East Berlin and elsewhere were viewed as part of a government effort to stop activists from staging protests to press their demands .
hold.v | 5 | Under the direction of its new chairman , Francisco Luzon , Spain 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization . The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior . The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , %% holds %% 8.42 % . The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .
hold.v | 2 | But attendance is down from previous years . What 's more , a Hong Kong textile trader says , some Chinese exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown by dragging their feet on soliciting new business . `` They are angry about the government ... so they %% hold %% back the goods , '' he said . This autumn 's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31 . Inside the 156,000-square-yard glass exhibition complex , products ranging from clothing to AK-47 machine guns are on display .
hold.v | 5 | It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan 's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan . The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression . In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently %% held %% raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake .
hold.v | 8 | On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion . That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay . ( After 1992 , the winter and summer Olympics will be %% held %% two years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . ) Now , Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness . Next month , talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .
hold.v | 2 | The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion . Despite the widening gap between the two sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference . That would %% hold %% spending on the program at about the previous year 's level . The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin ( D. , Wis . ) . As the head of the House conferees , Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production .
hold.v | 8 | James Grohl , a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions , said , `` The data is a red flag , but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . '' The trade group official added : `` Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it . '' Sen. Dixon %% held %% the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending . The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least . The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites .
hold.v | 8 | Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas . California 's insurance commissioner does n't %% hold %% hearings on acquisition applications . Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa . He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define policies and strategies of the group . ''
hold.v | 5 | The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from Australia 's Foreign Investment Review Board . Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd. has held the Australian Pepsi franchise for the past four years . Lion Nathan and PepsiCola Australia , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. of the U.S. , did n't say why Cadbury Schweppes will no longer %% hold %% the franchise .
hold.v | 4 | Medieval philosophers used to %% hold %% the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
hold.v | 2 | In coming months , emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity . Factory workers on strike knocked Poland 's Communist bosses off balance last year ; this year , it was the farmers who brought them down . In June , farmers %% held %% onto meat , milk and grain , waiting for July 's usual state-directed price rises . The Communists froze prices instead . The farmers ran a boycott , and meat disappeared from the shops .
hold.v | 5 | GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs . Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , exporters , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape . If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal government %% holds %% $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees . ( Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion . ) Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs .

The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world . Last year , when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course , the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to %% hold %% back the flood . `` Nothing is too good for our golf course , '' says Tony George , a mining engineer . Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month 's elections freeing the country from South African control , De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine 's productive life for another 25 years , from the current estimate of 10 .
hold.v | 5 | For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion . Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month . As of Aug. 31 , thrifts %% held %% $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities . The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
hold.v | 5 | MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products . The price was n't disclosed , but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd. , the MCA unit , said the closely %% held %% Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $ 20 million . The 40-year-old Buddy L concern , based in New York , designs and develops toys under the names `` Buddy L '' and `` My First Buddy , '' he said . MCA said it expects the proposed transaction to be completed `` no later than Nov. 10 .

He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the ( quarterly ) refunding '' of government debt to be %% held %% next month by the Treasury . A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two-year notes . Treasury , Agency Securities
hold.v | 5 | Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video . The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it %% holds %% a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business . While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium . `` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming .
hold.v | 8 | The House Appropriations Committee approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the quake region , less than the $ 3.8 billion sought by California officials . Hungary declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the Soviet Union . A crowd estimated at 100,000 %% held %% a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms .

hold.v | 5 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt %% held %% by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC .
hold.v | 8 | The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday . SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah . Burmah said it had n't %% held %% any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .

hold.v | 5 | That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam %% held %% a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .

A `` syndicate '' of shareholders %% holds %% just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares . Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi , the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas , a Belgian savings bank , and various family interests . A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control .
hold.v | 5 | But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , says zeros are particularly ill-suited . Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . That wo n't matter if they are %% held %% to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better .

While some 100 million ounces of silver once %% held %% by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says . Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
hold.v | 5 | Lep Group PLC of Britain , which %% holds %% a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company .

The two states and the state of Bavaria still %% hold %% a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern .
hold.v | 4 | While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it explains why voters %% hold %% Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .

Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees . Conservatives now %% hold %% only a 5-4 edge . One slot is expected to go to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas , a black conservative ; after mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against him .

The Bush administration accused Israeli Prime Minister Shamir of hindering peace efforts in the Mideast with `` unhelpful '' and disappointing statements .

hope.v | 1 | While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) said yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . '' Sen. Dole also said he %% hoped %% for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader . While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue . `` The administration should now state that if the { February } election is voided by the Sandinistas ... they should call for military aid , '' said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams .
hope.v | 1 | Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by Campeau , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction . Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's . %% Hoping %% to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out .

And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded . Two bills in Congress %% hope %% to make such restrictions national . In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D.

The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group 's First Boston Corp. unit , Morgan Stanley & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit . Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a General Electric Co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with Morgan Stanley , is n't a market maker , although the Big Board %% hopes %% that will change . Similarly , the Big Board hopes to entice Merrill Lynch & Co . Neither has plans to be a market maker for now .
hope.v | 1 | `` The Famous Teddy Z , '' which CBS Inc. had %% hoped %% would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged . Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season . `` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen .
hope.v | 1 | Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo . As it bids for new agreements , new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world , the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem . So after 70 years , it is confessing the obvious , %% hoping %% to be believed about other things . It 's not enough . If the Soviets want to be believed , they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious .
hope.v | 1 | Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed . The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . They said they %% hoped %% to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said . The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday .
hope.v | 1 | A White House budget office analysis estimates that $ 500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California 's needs , and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration . `` Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we 've got to address it , '' said Mr. Darman , who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session . `` I would %% hope %% very much that we would n't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat . '' Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans , no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten . A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative .
hope.v | 1 | What now ? To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety . Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies %% hoped %% to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing . Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' ( North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 ) is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it . Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
hope.v | 1 | Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed . Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest level since 1980 . While lower joblessness is generally good news , the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as %% hoped %% -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months . Meanwhile , average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year . Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record # 10.2 billion ( $ 16.22 billion ) last month , a much higher level than economists had predicted .
hope.v | 1 | Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel %% hope %% to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
hope.v | 1 | The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier . Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them . And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still %% hope %% to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . `` The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , '' says Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama . `` He has mastered the art of survival . ''
hope.v | 1 | The battle is not easy . We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders . Persons developed in today 's corporations can not %% hope %% to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do . Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .
hope.v | 1 | `` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you do n't quite understand the situation here . Do n't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church ? ? Tenements , stores , saloons , some gambling , I %% hope %% not too much . The colored people are getting employment at Kent House and other places , and they are near their places of employment . When a city has arranged things like this you can not easily change them .
hope.v | 1 | The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them . He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . He had %% hoped %% to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him . Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .
hope.v | 1 | Therefore , he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view . A half hour later the Vice President arrived . He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing , as though %% hoping %% to store this information carefully in his mind . He observed the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier . He said to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre .
hope.v | 1 | `` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said . `` I know something about Eromonga . Let 's %% hope %% we come to a safer place '' . But we did n't . Three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view .
hope.v | 1 | But I 'm sure the other one was Lou '' . What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification . She realized I 'd have to notify the police , but fervently %% hoped %% I could avoid mentioning her name . Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits . But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits .
hope.v | 1 | Much as they had to look forward to , they did n't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go . At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes . She had spent too many hours looking ahead , %% hoping %% and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness . And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all .
hope.v | 1 | But she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken . Facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool . She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but %% hope %% that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it . The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand . The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle .
hope.v | 1 | I 'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me '' . He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream . The coyote was calling again , and he %% hoped %% that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it . Not tonight , at any rate . He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .
hope.v | 1 | He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all . I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , %% hoping %% to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern . I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it . My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly .
hope.v | 1 | Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note . `` I 've got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion . %% Hope %% you do n't mind '' . `` Of course I do n't mind '' , she answered . `` You 're having a miserable time , are n't you ? ?
hope.v | 1 | `` I 'm not trying to worry you '' . `` Well , all right then '' . The cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , %% hoping %% she would notice what he was doing . At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance . Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ? He wondered .
hope.v | 1 | Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he could n't pyramid with any consecutive success . `` How 's your luck , honey '' ? ? A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him . She looked well-fed and prosperous , but he did n't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he 'd been %% hoping %% . `` I have n't had any luck since I was a baby '' . `` Stake me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice .
hope.v | 1 | ( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . ) Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before . I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , %% hoping %% that her earthy advice would help me . `` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , I said . `` What is Letch interested in '' ? ?
hour.n | 4 | Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants . Meanwhile , at home , Mitsubishi has control of some major projects . It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama , about an %% hour %% outside Tokyo . The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year . The centerpiece of that complex , the Landmark Tower , will be Japan 's tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .
hour.n | 1 | `` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the nation 's labor laws , said Roger Porter , assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy . White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage , the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush . The bill vetoed by the president in June , which the House failed to override , would have lifted the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an %% hour %% by late 1991 , with a training wage for up to two months , generally for a worker 's first job . Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan .
hour.n | 1 | You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air currents . Which makes the chase car necessary . Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an %% hour %% . When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion . Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket .
hour.n | 1 | That was when the exchange took a new tack by publishing monthly statistics listing the top 15 program trading firms . Exchange officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading . People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even %% hours %% of heavy program trading and who was doing it . Meanwhile , another big Wall Street brokerage firm joined others that have been pulling back from program trading . American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit said it ceased all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts .
hour.n | 1 | We got some exposure ... and pretty much good will . '' The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw . While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even %% hours %% . The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market . They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago .
hour.n | 1 | Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account , and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients . Yet that did n't eliminate program trading from the market . The Dow industrials shot up 23 points in the opening %% hour %% , at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading involving futures contracts . But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports . The first is Wednesday 's survey of purchasing managers , considered a good indicator of how the nation 's manufacturing sector fared in October .
hour.n | 1 | Student job postings at Boston University slip 10 % this year following a 10 % drop in 1988 . Still , the school says there are an ample number and pay is up to $ 7.20 an hour from $ 6.90 last year . M.B.A. candidates at the University of Pittsburgh earn up to $ 15 an %% hour %% on marketing or computer projects .

hour.n | 1 | A supremely cautious man , the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow . Indeed , his caution has become legendary within the government . He fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens of ways , probing for %% hours %% in search of potential problems . After thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small . Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge .

The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market . West Germany 's biggest union , IG Metall , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter %% hours %% with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries . Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in next year 's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal . A major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37 .

Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery , the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches , has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22 % larger than Compaq 's . Its keyboard , according to industry consultants , is better than Compaq 's , but its battery life of two to three %% hours %% is shorter . It does n't have an internal floppy disk drive , although a snap-on drive can be purchased separately . Its greatest drawback may be its 3-inch thickness , big enough for one consultant to describe it as `` clunky . ''
hour.n | 1 | Owners of the building in New York say they will be asking $ 50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that Exxon is vacating . In Texas , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said .

'' The two men spent an %% hour %% at Exit 10 , rehashing the event , `` fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50 , '' Mr. Engelken says . His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca `` a very fine pitcher .

hour.n | 1 | The state attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices . Flight Attendants Lag Before Jets Even Land IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight %% hours %% . A recent study for the Federal Aviation Administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work 16 hours or more straight -- despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to 14 hours . Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in 20-hour work days , the study found .
hour.n | 1 | Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in 20-hour work days , the study found . This happens because the FAA does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants ; by contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers , usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours . `` As far as the FAA is concerned , '' says Matt Finucane , air safety director at the Association of Flight Attendants , `` flight attendants can work an unlimited number of %% hours %% . '' Experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk . For instance , tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation .
hour.n | 1 | `` They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation . '' In response to the study , the FAA says it is considering changing its policy -- or lack of it -- on flight attendants . The agency may not have much choice : A congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on U.S. flights and 16 %% hours %% on international trips . Odds and Ends GOLF HAS BECOME the latest diversion for travelers stuck at some airports .
hour.n | 1 | But London 's problems were nothing compared with the Continent 's . In Brussels , which recently spent millions of dollars on a computer-assisted trading system , disgusted traders watched helplessly as a software failure before opening on Manic Monday prevented trading for two days . For 48 %% hours %% , no one had any idea precisely how much his securities were worth . By Wednesday , frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard . The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week , with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who developed the system .

hour.n | 1 | Eavesdropping by individuals is harder to measure . But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail . The Counter Spy Shop in Washington , D.C. , for instance , offers the `` Secret Connection '' attache case , which can surreptitiously record conversations for nine %% hours %% at a stretch . That and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands , but simple voice-activated tape recorders sell for as little as $ 70 at electronics stores like Radio Shack . The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say private investigators .
hour.n | 1 | CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news . ( Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $ 25 million to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 %% hours %% of additional events . ) Barry Frank , the agent who took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March , says that even if CBS loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little . `` Ten million ai n't jack , man , when you got $ 3 billion sitting in the bank , '' says Mr. Frank , senior vice president at International Management Group , citing CBS 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses .
hour.n | 2 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular %% hours %% on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
hour.n | 1 | The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock . The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps . The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a `` massive buying effort '' as UAL jumped $ 20 a share to $ 170 in the last half %% hour %% , said Mr. Bates . With 15 seconds of trading to go , Mr. Jacobson , with what voice he had left , announced to the trading mob : `` We 're going to trade one price on the bell . '' That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds , as a way of making sure that last-second orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers .
hour.n | 2 | For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek , modern railcars . Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping . Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd %% hours %% , or that many workers are still staying at home . Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations . In the best of times , the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more .
hour.n | 1 | `` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol . There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role . The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four %% hours %% rather than the usual two-hour crush . Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work . Of Bechtel 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay .
hour.n | 2 | The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9-5 hours , a spokesman says . Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % . At Pacific Telesis Group , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business %% hours %% , a spokeswoman says . Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock . One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay .

hour.n | 1 | For many , it began to look like a replay of Oct. 13 . As stocks and stock-index futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the S&P 500 stock futures pit . Under a post-1987 crash reform , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange would n't permit the December S&P futures to fall further than 12 points for a half %% hour %% . That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the Big Board . But at a critical moment , stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control .

Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier . Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure %% hours %% of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities . The Volokhs were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk . They did n't .
hour.n | 2 | UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading %% hours %% Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid . But the board said it was n't interested for now .
hour.n | 1 | Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 . ( Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . ) Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor %% hours %% required to produce a unit . By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said . In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .

When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several %% hours %% before dying down , he said . Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic .

hour.n | 1 | `` That means we can accept orders '' and begin getting back to normal , says Ms. Tharp . Prompted by an earlier California earthquake , as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower , Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $ 75,000 equipping a trailer with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters . Although officials of the savings and loan , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. , used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake , they still lost touch for more than 24 %% hours %% with 15 branches in the affected areas , not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open . `` Some people flat out did n't know what to do , '' says Robert G.

The traffic jam out of the park was monumental . It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an additional %% hour %% to reach an inner roadway a half-block away . The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours .

hour.n | 2 | Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees `` felt abandoned by the former owners , '' says the University of Florida sociologist . But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds , like expense-account fudging and phone misuse . Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura , Calif. , thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch %% hours %% and increased absenteeism , conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts . New management can take several steps to reduce dishonesty . Most important , experts say , is to show that a company 's ethical tone is set at the top .
hour.n | 2 | The deposits , assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred to newly chartered federal mutual institutions . The three institutions are : Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association , Wichita , which had $ 830.5 million in assets ; Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen , McAllen , Texas , with $ 582.6 million in assets ; and Surety Savings Association , El Paso , with $ 309.3 million in assets . The three insolvent thrifts will maintain normal business %% hours %% and operations under RTC-appointed managing agents , while the RTC tries to negotiate permanent resolutions .

Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 %% hours %% pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business .
hour.n | 1 | A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built . But , given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business , the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas . Several factors apparently spared the Valley -- a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto -- from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco , an %% hour %% 's drive north . For one thing , buildings there tend to be newer and , thus , in step with the latest safety codes . Also , the soil in the Valley is solid , unlike the landfill of San Francisco 's downtown Marina District , which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
hour.n | 1 | Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact . Tuesday night , thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel . Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an %% hour %% normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows , an FAA spokeswoman said . While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton , Calif. ; Reno and Las Vegas , Nev. ; and Los Angeles . United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
hour.n | 1 | While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows . Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen . It also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two %% hours %% later .

hour.n | 2 | After gaining strength during a brief run-up when trading began , the Nasdaq Composite Index weakened under selling pressure . The forces at work included computer-guided trading , as well as profit-driven market makers and institutional investors who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction . During the last two %% hours %% of trading , the composite almost drew even on the day before slipping again . The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05 , or 0.2 % , to 459.93 . The action was confined to Nasdaq 's biggest and most liquid stocks , traders said .
hour.n | 1 | The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses . Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures . But while the Merc reopened a half %% hour %% later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade . Exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed .
hour.n | 1 | `` But the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably .

State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties . BNL also said that its board had approved `` after an in-depth discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to %% improve %% controls on its foreign branches .

improve.v | 1 | Such sentiment is being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market later this week and in early November . The expected amount is said to be 700 billion yen ( $ 4.93 billion ) to 1.05 trillion yen -- the second largest amount this year in a given period , following the record high set at the end of July , according to market observers . In addition to a large amount of investment trust fund cash , analysts generally see the market environment %% improving %% compared with the past couple of weeks . Toshiyuki Nishimura , an analyst at Yamaichi Securities , said , `` The market sentiment is bullish , simply because there are few bad factors . '' Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization , domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen .
improve.v | 1 | Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to %% improve %% the operation of capital markets . For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .
improve.v | 1 | John Kriz , a Moody 's vice president , said Boston Safe Deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities . The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said . Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to %% improve %% credit quality . '' As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he said . But he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market .

This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . The center %% improves %% the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . An additional benefit is the creation of jobs . This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
improve.v | 1 | Ortega 's hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled . The young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge ; ; he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights . He borrows the insights of psychology to %% improve %% his impaired vision but can not bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist 's own . He has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character . If many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego .
job.n | 1 | Industry executives are wishing Mr. Achenbaum well . Leonard Matthews , then-president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies , called Mr. Achenbaum a `` quisling '' in an incendiary 1987 speech .

The union sued the state in November 1985 , alleging that it intentionally segregated job classifications by sex and paid employees in predominantly female jobs less than males in comparable %% jobs %% . The UAW also charged that the state applied its own standards for determining pay in a discriminatory manner . In November 1987 , a district court judge in Detroit ruled against the UAW .
job.n | 2 | Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their %% jobs %% . Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers .

'' Mr. Wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee 's hearings , which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D. , Texas ) has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his %% job %% . `` A couple of things Mr. Newsom said were at least misleading , '' said Kevin O'Connell , one of the Washington regulators responsible for the handling of Lincoln . In an interview , he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss , and forced Lincoln to make an $ 18 million downward adjustment on another .

job.n | 1 | Independent providers of financial information , including Quotron , have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue . Shearson , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data . The %% job %% cuts , to be made in a number of areas at various job levels , are `` a streamlining of operations , '' a spokeswoman said . The company has no immediate plans to close any operations , she said , but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house , including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data . The spokeswoman said the move is n't directly a response to Quotron 's loss of its two biggest customers , Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co.

As the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the government faces a daunting %% job %% of rebuilding confidence in its policies . The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again .

job.n | 1 | HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week , but received little support from the White House budget office , which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments . Within discretionary funds for community development grants , more than $ 3.7 million is allocated to six projects in Michigan , home state of a subcommittee chairman , Rep. Bob Traxler . House Speaker Thomas Foley won $ 510,000 for a project in his district in Washington state , and $ 1.3 million , earmarked by Sen.

job.n | 1 | October employment data -- also could turn out to be the most confusing . On the surface , the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September 's 5.3 % . But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll %% jobs %% is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , economists said . The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September 's 209,000 increase . But the important factory-jobs segment , which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events .
job.n | 1 | Members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day . In this case , the Members outdid themselves .

Indeed , during Mr. Breeden 's confirmation hearing last month , senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the %% job %% . These days , Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday 's harrowing morning session .

job.n | 1 | One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . '' By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R . Ms. Volokh quit her %% job %% , to remove herself from the public eye . The wait was miserable . Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier .
job.n | 1 | He had been president of the international operations . Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP . Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express %% job %% . Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold . Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
job.n | 1 | Who 'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents ? Chicago 's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough . At his old %% job %% in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member . At his first Chicago press conference , he berated the reporters . In New York City , the new Chancellor , Joseph Fernandez , has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform .
job.n | 1 | The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . '' Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End RECENT LAW school graduates are starting %% jobs %% with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class . Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school . `` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course .
job.n | 1 | Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses . This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all %% jobs %% nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York . Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime . The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees .
job.n | 1 | This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . An additional benefit is the creation of %% jobs %% . This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers . It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job .
job.n | 1 | Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong . Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . Some %% jobs %% already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
job.n | 3 | If you think you have stress-related problems on the %% job %% , there 's good news and bad news . You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
job.n | 1 | It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business . The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular %% jobs %% as sales people in other fields . For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 . The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it .
job.n | 1 | And that 's a problem . Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . `` I hope he grows with the %% job %% , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
job.n | 1 | COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe . Britain , France and Italy pull out of a proposal to build new NATO frigates ; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects . Defense experts say joint projects are increasingly squeezed by budget pressures and the desire to save domestic %% jobs %% ; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears . BOTH SIDES NOW : Virginia GOP lieutenant governor candidate Eddy Dalton tries to have it both ways on the abortion issue .
job.n | 2 | The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . All told , Mr. Parker does a better %% job %% of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . But there are grounds for complaint . At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
job.n | 2 | After six months on the run , Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled . He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights . He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd %% jobs %% . Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper . In 1988 , 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise , district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work .
job.n | 1 | His Levinson Institute in Belmont , Mass. , has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program . Employers foot the bill , he says , figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company . One East Coast manufacturing executive , faced with a %% job %% transfer his wife resented , found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move . And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage . More dual-career couples also are getting help , with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .
job.n | 2 | San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday 's catastrophic earthquake . `` The press has been doing an excellent %% job %% . They are telling people what roads are closed and just keeping the public informed has helped to keep the panic down , '' said James Ball , a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department . Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books , explaining where to call for help .
job.n | 1 | They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork , and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar . Rep. Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . She says it 'd create 600 %% jobs %% and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''
job.n | 2 | Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs . As thanks , the egg industry tried to break him . And the egg producers have done a pretty good %% job %% . They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress . Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella .
job.n | 1 | Stan Hathcock , an Atlanta garage owner who opposes a longer warranty , estimates that the current plan costs him as much as $ 15,000 a year in lost business . SMALL TALK : Some 70 % of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they 'd prefer to work in or own a small company , yet most take %% jobs %% with large concerns , says a survey by the Foster McKay Group , a New York recruiting firm ... .

job.n | 1 | `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain power . '' A National Guard %% job %% assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses .
job.n | 2 | Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . `` If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? '' She said , `` I would say K mart 's number one %% job %% is to address its market-share loss { in discount stores } , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins . At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' But K mart 's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses .
join.v | 2 | The Canadian government , with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America , is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of American States , a Washington-based regional agency . The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba , the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua 's Contra guerrillas . Latin American countries have long urged Canada to %% join %% the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the U.S. , which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization . Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a Washington priority . `` The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada 's membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , '' said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. .
join.v | 2 | The other lawyer in the office is partner Robert A. Macari , the firm 's legislative director . THE PHILADELPHIA law firm of Ballard , Spahr , Andrews & Ingersoll said three partners have joined its business and finance department . John Ake , 48 , a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at American Capital Management & Research Inc. , in Houston , will %% join %% Ballard Spahr 's corporate-securities practice . Kent Walker , 45 , a former partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Mesirov , Gelman , Jaffe , Cramer & Jamieson , will specialize in antitrust , real estate and mergers and acquisitions . Richard L.

join.v | 2 | Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. , a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players . Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from %% joining %% Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say . Time officials declined to comment . Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers .
join.v | 2 | On Aug. 1 , the state tore up its controls , and food prices leaped . Without buffer stocks , inflation exploded . That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and %% joined %% with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government . But by the time Solidarity took office in September , the damage was done . `` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
join.v | 2 | A spokesman said that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment . `` We will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' the spokesman said . Mr. Goldston , who had been president of Faberge Inc. 's Faberge U.S.A. division before %% joining %% Reebok in September 1988 , left in August to pursue other interests .
join.v | 3 | And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties . Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North . The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , %% joined %% with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . '' No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it . What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
join.v | 3 | The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York . The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti . They will be %% joined %% by Larry Gainen , who resigned from the firm of LePatner , Gainen & Block . Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . '' Mr. Rubenstein said the five , who were n't on Shea & Gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . ''
join.v | 2 | Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to %% join %% the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
join.v | 2 | Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II ended . Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . Since %% joining %% the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker . In fact , the two men have had strikingly similar career paths , both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position . Moreover , both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy .
join.v | 4 | The gathering is expected to focus on curbing the fouling of rivers and lakes , limiting damage from industrial accidents and improving the handling of harmful chemicals . West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said Bonn is convinced of the need for cooperation , `` especially with our neighbors in the East , because we are directly affected by their ecological progress or lack of it . '' The U.S. and Canada %% joined %% every European country except Albania at the meeting . The Swedish publishers of a new Estonian-language newspaper rushed an extra edition across the Baltic on Oct. 10 after the first run sold out in one day . Editor Hasse Olsson said plans had called for 7,000 copies of the monthly Are Paev ( Business Paper ) to be sold at newsstands and an additional 3,000 promotion issues to be sent by direct mail .
join.v | 2 | The women who come to West Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move . Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums . Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to %% join %% the beatniks . Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated . Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .
join.v | 1 | As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities . In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras %% joined %% under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor . In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini 's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .
join.v | 4 | Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor . Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years . Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would %% join %% the others . They would sleep while the Gabriel 's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured . Upon reaching the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey 's end .
join.v | 3 | He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner . The area was deserted . A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike 's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to %% join %% the confused activity at the east end of the stockade . Mike crawled to the door and peered in . The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
join.v | 4 | His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds . His speed was dropping rapidly . If he spun out now , he would %% join %% his opponent on the ground . Wingman , stay clear , he prayed . He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .
join.v | 2 | They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about . There was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss 's wife and son to %% join %% the outfit . It especially bothered the older hands . The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .
join.v | 2 | What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' . He could certainly talk . The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself -- and %% joined %% the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work .
keep.v | 8 | Oleg A. Grinevsky , the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks , argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks , while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe . But the issue is stickier than it seems . France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to %% keep %% out of the talks . And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter , more transportable , high-technology tanks . Defining combat aircraft is even tougher .
keep.v | 8 | The staff brags about psyllium 's hefty contribution to American regularity , without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol . The council 's annual report has psyllium on its last page , lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and `` Nux vomica , '' a plant that induces vomiting . In one way , the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to %% keep %% news of the boom to themselves . They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year . But there 's a catch .
keep.v | 1 | Still , some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are %% keeping %% mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` European companies are looking to buy American ones , '' said Henry King , the managing partner at that firm . `` But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions . ''
keep.v | 1 | IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips . While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips . And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to %% keep %% U.S. equipment makers healthy . Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market . IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing .
keep.v | 8 | Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose . They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses . Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and %% keep %% unscrupulous competitors away , '' says Sidney West , president of TechDesign International Inc. , a Springfield , Va. , business that designs telecommunication and other products . Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . '' Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules .
keep.v | 1 | But by the time Solidarity took office in September , the damage was done . `` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper . The cost of raising a pig %% kept %% bounding ahead of the return for selling one . The farmers stayed angry . They still are .
keep.v | 4 | Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer . Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always %% keep %% the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples .
keep.v | 1 | In July unfilled orders grew 1 % . But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . `` It means we 're eating into the bread that %% keeps %% us going . That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said . `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . ''
keep.v | 1 | The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams . Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year . `` Those kinds of issues always %% keep %% coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office . DESPITE VICTORIES this year , small business fears losing parental-leave war . Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
keep.v | 1 | Ironically , American Airlines ' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry ( Sept. 20 ) . You quote Robert Crandall , chairman of American 's parent , AMR Corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to Detroit because you have to go to Detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . '' Even if Mr. Crandall is correct , he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to %% keep %% prices at a competitive level . In 1986 , he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff 's president that they both raise fares 20 % . ( Braniff declined ) .
keep.v | 8 | If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . Then , in 1988 , a proposal to %% keep %% better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members .
keep.v | 8 | However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel . With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a Chanel look . '' She %% keeps %% track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox . Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona , along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes , the parties she throws for 500 people , the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara ? `` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote Movieline 's national expansion .
keep.v | 4 | Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day . That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to %% keep %% prices from eroding further . The group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990 . With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices .
keep.v | 1 | Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo . The sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to %% keep %% most of the government operating past Wednesday . The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the Appropriations Committee today . The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration .

'' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
keep.v | 8 | Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion . Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri . There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't %% keep %% an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day . '' That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs. Wade . In two other cases , the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear even more unintended .
keep.v | 5 | Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person %% keep %% an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . It also adds to the mystery of the venture . Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
keep.v | 1 | The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee . Prepayments , much like mutual-fund purchases , are pooled for investment . Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to %% keep %% ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns . But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so . One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable .
keep.v | 1 | Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already ! We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we %% keep %% disposing of it . Bank it ? Not really !
keep.v | 1 | Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board . Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions . Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will %% keep %% prices firm . Copper Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon .
keep.v | 1 | To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates . Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South . To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to %% keep %% such Democrats in office . Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House . Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
keep.v | 1 | The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 . The brigade has n't been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case . George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to %% keep %% happy . We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such . The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it .
keep.v | 1 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he %% kept %% coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
keep.v | 4 | Under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers . Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright 's remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole . First , Wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately %% kept %% him from seeing the dreadful town . But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? ? `` That is n't a boulevard , it 's a racetrack '' ! ! Cried Wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920 's .
keep.v | 8 | Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; ; they are priceless even though they can not be recorded on a ledger page ; ; they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will %% keep %% the sheriff away '' . That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . Criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .
keep.v | 3 | Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense . His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; ; the two may in fact be identical . His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; ; he %% keeps %% a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated '' . The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' . `` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' .
keep.v | 1 | He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
keep.v | 1 | The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it . Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin . They roll at night in ashes to %% keep %% warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it . In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; ; as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic . The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .
keep.v | 1 | Times Square , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey . Heavy-coated , severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic . The night was cold but the crowd %% kept %% one warm . The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner . Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one 's ears were continually serenaded by the horns ' rasps and bleats .
keep.v | 8 | That house was ten years off his life let himself . Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier . He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on %% keeping %% it up . Ten years ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed . The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing .
keep.v | 1 | She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she %% kept %% herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .
keep.v | 5 | The same month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege Of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley 's generosity rebelled at . The lordly poet was at low-water mark . The careless writing was in %% keeping %% with his mood of savage discontent . On all sides doors were being slammed in his face . The previous scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity .
keep.v | 8 | Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle . On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island . The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , %% kept %% his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets . They often threw tidbits overboard . The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .
keep.v | 4 | He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes . He then draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother 's lap . The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ; only the instructions from his rabbi %% kept %% him from bolting . But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends . He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi .
keep.v | 4 | Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade . He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to %% keep %% it from blowing in his eyes . Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below .
keep.v | 1 | Look at thum . That goddamn redheader was the worst . He %% kept %% sayin , not me , not me , I do n't wanta wind up like em . But I told him , goddammit . `` I told him '' , he said aloud They 'll get the guys that done it .
keep.v | 1 | They 'll toe the line . Goddamn it . %% Keep %% the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible . Less bull the more you can do with em . That 's Brown 's trouble .
keep.v | 1 | His own fate he accepted . He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan . The dromozoa %% kept %% him alive , but he did not know how they did it . He staggered back to the group . The Lady Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her .
keep.v | 2 | He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean 's affections from her . And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride . He handed the bayonet to Dean and %% kept %% the pistol . `` Stay well back of me '' , he said . `` I 'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I 'm one of the guerrillas .
keep.v | 1 | Zingggg-O ! ! Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting . He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to %% keep %% the records straight . Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer 's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I 'm finished . `` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said .
keep.v | 1 | Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him . Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang . They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , %% kept %% him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses . Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort . On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .
keep.v | 8 | Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks . The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff . The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and %% kept %% on rising . They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom . The cloudburst cut off abruptly .
keep.v | 5 | If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he %% keep %% the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
keep.v | 1 | No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in %% keeping %% with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' . After their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` Hoe-Down '' .
keep.v | 1 | Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now . Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing . Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to %% keep %% her thoughts off Tom Brannon . Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday . He 'd come alone , without his wife and child .
keep.v | 1 | `` How do the valley people feel '' ? ? `` As mad as ever . But Kruger 's men %% keep %% them off balance , and they do n't trust me . I 'm an outsider . When they learn you 're in the hills though , they 'll rally , do n't worry about that '' .
keep.v | 1 | Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be %% kept %% dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
keep.v | 8 | `` Do n't worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could . Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of it . `` And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and %% keep %% an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time . And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing '' . `` What are you going to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything '' ? ?
keep.v | 1 | Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him . The Allstates Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism . Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy 's instinct was to %% keep %% growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . With Herberet 's blessing , he was convinced that Allstates ' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind . At that point William came into the picture .
keep.v | 4 | To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd . Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his . The knowledge %% kept %% him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism . The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts . He sat down on the bed .
keep.v | 8 | `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to %% keep %% up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
keep.v | 1 | `` Not onions '' , came the answer the following day . `` Ugh '' . Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she %% kept %% the sweater fast-frozen . But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense . Take Vivian .
keep.v | 1 | I huddled miserably beside him in the truck . It was all my doing -- his seeing her . Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to %% keep %% it . At first , Johnnie had n't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ? But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that 's how you want it , that 's how it 'll be '' .
keep.v | 3 | `` I do n't see Alma anywhere '' , I said . `` She 's invisible tonight . C'mon , let 's find out where they 're %% keeping %% the glasses '' . I drew back . `` I -- I do n't think so , Ronald .
keep.v | 3 | Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it was n't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . But I must n't start on Alice . She is a closed book , a picture I %% keep %% on my bureau , but never look at . If she 'd kept on as she 'd been going , the story I 'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , Gladdy 's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .
keep.v | 1 | The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics . We did n't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights . It was thought wiser to %% keep %% them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward . The moment I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed . They 'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she 'd pretty much slept off her drunk .
keep.v | 8 | He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day . John was good at his job . It probably was n't hard for him to %% keep %% his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to . Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John 's first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of Edythe . But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John 's success at his work only made Edythe 's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring .
keep.v | 2 | Susan was an active character ; ; for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls . Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ; she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her . You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still %% kept %% its comforting magic . `` How was Cathy '' ? ? `` Subdued .
keep.v | 1 | Then they took a taxi to Trastevere . `` There 's a church you should see '' , she said . And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to %% keep %% a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto . He let her tell him all about the church . Then they had dinner .
keep.v | 1 | There was no lock because Herman did n't allow a lock . A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping . The toilet had n't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you could n't %% keep %% the public out -- entirely . She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall . The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot .
keep.v | 6 | Rachel faced me . Her bright eyes were twinkling . She said , `` Sometimes I think they are %% keeping %% religion for us while we play around . Your mother hated this way of life . She wished to change much for the children here '' .
keep.v | 2 | If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it . In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own . It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and %% keep %% this thing . `` You 've told God , Frank '' , he said . `` Why lacerate the -- congregation '' ? ?
keep.v | 4 | Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home . However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to %% keep %% my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . When I arrived at Viola 's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook 's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .
keep.v | 8 | And she would wink and throw kisses . They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . But they %% kept %% on clapping for a long , long time . `` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you 're going to tell me what I am and what I 'm doing . It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' .
keep.v | 3 | `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' . Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . I now felt it wiser to %% keep %% Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around . Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory .
kill.v | 1 | Azem Vlasi and 14 others are accused of inciting riots and strikes and opposing constitutional limits to Kosovo 's autonomy . If convicted , they could be sentenced to death . A court in Jerusalem sentenced a Palestinian to 16 life terms for forcing a bus off a cliff July 6 , %% killing %% 16 people , Israeli radio reported . He also received 20-year sentences for each of the 24 passengers injured . It was considered the stiffest sentence passed since the start of the 22-month-old Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories .
kill.v | 1 | These are the last words Abbie Hoffman ever uttered , more or less , before he %% killed %% himself . And You Are There , sort of : ABBIE : `` I 'm OK , Jack .
kill.v | 1 | MURDER THREAT charged in Haas Securities Corp . stock-manipulation trial . In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff , the defense accused one of the government 's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff . Mr. Laff 's attorney , John Lang , filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness , Henry Lorin , told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be %% killed %% . The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang said was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff . In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it .
kill.v | 4 | President Bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority . Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to %% kill %% individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill . He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .
kill.v | 1 | And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . The antibody then %% kills %% the cell . Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days . In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
kill.v | 1 | He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody . `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially %% kill %% all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara .
kill.v | 1 | `` Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment . `` He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score . There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd %% kill %% me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement ... The only time the violin has it is right at the end . It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue-like .
kill.v | 1 | As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi . It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal . Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will %% kill %% a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
kill.v | 1 | In terms of sheer brutality , the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world . The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas . The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and %% kill %% . Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years . Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops .
kill.v | 1 | Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . `` When elephants start fighting , ants get %% killed %% , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
kill.v | 1 | Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington estimated that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , %% killing %% at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag . While the proposal won a slight majority , the 51-48 vote was well short of the two-thirds needed to approve changes in the Constitution .
kill.v | 1 | AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK Northern California , %% killing %% more than 50 people . The violent temblor , which lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale , also caused the collapse of a 30-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and shook Candlestick Park . The tremor was centered near Hollister , southeast of San Francisco , and was felt as far as 200 miles away .
kill.v | 1 | He finds it in utter misery and desolation . All his people ask for is no more war . But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is %% killed %% in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died . He had become king at fifteen . Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .
kill.v | 1 | No one would question such an errand . The bottle was filled up with flour . Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been %% killed %% . Now it would have another death . From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry .
kill.v | 1 | She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed . Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically . If Hal Yarrow had been %% killed %% in a crash , he must have wanted it that way . There was no such thing as an `` accident '' . Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
kill.v | 1 | It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so . I believed him . They %% killed %% Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago . My men , they all left me . Just cleared out .
kill.v | 1 | Dan Morgan '' . He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple . They might %% kill %% him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house . He dismissed the possibility at once . The girl 's thin face haunted him .
kill.v | 1 | `` Anyway '' , Waddell went on . `` It 's nothing to fool with . It can %% kill %% you . Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' . `` Nobody 's giving anything up '' , Robinson said .
kill.v | 1 | He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles . He did n't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself . He could n't stop %% killing %% . That was his true love , not Penny . The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .
kill.v | 1 | He backed Jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man 's shirtfront , and drew back his right fist . `` Tell me about Arbuckle ! ! You %% killed %% him , did n't you '' ? ? `` It was Brenner 's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose . `` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .
kill.v | 1 | No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer . Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he %% killed %% Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state . It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .
kill.v | 1 | I meant him no harm . I 've given willful hurt to no man . I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he 's going to %% kill %% me . Beat me to death in front of a hundred people . Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .
kill.v | 1 | In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river . `` I think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly . `` Let the savages %% kill %% each other . What do we care '' ? ? Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .
kill.v | 1 | The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . You beauty , I said , I could n't %% kill %% you . You are much too beautiful . I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .
kill.v | 1 | `` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' . `` You are talking foolishly '' , I said . `` You %% killed %% it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' . `` They 're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted . `` Nobody likes snakes '' .
kill.v | 1 | The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . I 'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to %% kill %% it at last , for it could never live . The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . `` It 's a big snake , is n't it '' ? ? He said .
kill.v | 1 | We 're ruined and he 's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' -- `` you 'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously . I was plenty scared . In the state she was in , she could actually %% kill %% him ! ! `` Now you just take it easy , and I 'll make you some tea '' -- `` Tea , '' Nadine screeched . `` How can you be so damn stupid ? ?
kill.v | 1 | Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wo n't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and %% kill %% her , and that is being an old maid too . It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull . And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .
lead.v | 1 | The government also urged whites to refrain from panic over growing black protests , such as the massive anti-apartheid rally Sunday on the outskirts of Soweto . Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could %% lead %% to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait . A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said . The blast , which wrecked the opposition labor group 's offices , was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador 's 10-year-old civil war .
lead.v | 1 | Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer . Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too . Where these discoveries will %% lead %% , scientists can only speculate . Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies . Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
lead.v | 1 | Said 's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser , whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952 . By 1961 , Mr. Mahfouz 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in Said . His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real robbers '' -- the rich `` dogs '' who prey on the poor -- %% leads %% only to the death of innocents , and eventually to his own . Cairo 's spirited squalor also has gone gray . Here , the city is dark and laden with symbolism : Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society .
lead.v | 2 | Senate Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the %% leading %% Senate proposal . Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House . Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
lead.v | 2 | The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs ( US$ 119.2 million ) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988 . Revenue climbed 13 % to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion . Generale des Eaux said the earnings gain was %% led %% by its water , energy and building activities .
lead.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could %% lead %% to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
lead.v | 2 | The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors . A hearing is scheduled on the issue today . The government 's 136-page filing covers events %% leading %% up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts . GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the Minuteman case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court . In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts , prosecutors contend that `` high-level GE executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985 .
lead.v | 4 | It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , %% led %% by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states . But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
lead.v | 2 | The company says it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with bourbon representing most of that amount . Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays . The company 's I.W. Harper brand is the %% leading %% bourbon in Japan , with 40 % of the market . Bourbon exporters have succeeded in Japan where other industries have failed , avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents . Jim Beam Brands has a distribution partnership with Nikka Whiskey Co. , a distiller .
lead.v | 2 | Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 . Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said %% leading %% advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group . Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction . The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
lead.v | 2 | France 's industrial production index for July and August rose 1 % from June and was up 4.6 % from a year ago , according to seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistics Institute . The state agency , which usually publishes the data on monthly basis , but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months , said the advance was %% led %% by output of consumer goods , which rose 3.5 % from June and was up 7.2 % from a year earlier . Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing , with a monthly rise of 2 % and a year-on-year advance of 3 % . Food production was ahead 1.7 % from June and 5.3 % from a year earlier .
lead.v | 2 | In this case , China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $ 8.7 billion , based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20 % and exports 10 % . If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit . But since June , foreign bankers %% led %% by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China . Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before . In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China 's deteriorating political and economic environment .
lead.v | 1 | He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform . Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards , one for each school . This of course %% led %% to disaster in New York City . Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential , but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them . The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems .
lead.v | 4 | It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would %% lead %% a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
lead.v | 2 | But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines . All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date . Of the funds that fared the worst in the post-Oct . 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which %% led %% the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy-out plan . Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for National Aviation & Technology . The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign , said A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical .
lead.v | 2 | He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . '' There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis . The %% leading %% contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs . And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election . Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in .
lead.v | 1 | Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s . `` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . A further decline in prices will %% lead %% to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says . Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says .
lead.v | 2 | MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will %% lead %% the underwriters . Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\/casino and theme park .
lead.v | 4 | When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion , Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics . Then a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers . Now she %% leads %% a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio . `` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she says , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent , Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter . `` People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue .
lead.v | 1 | Unlike the other nations of the bloc , East Germany is a creature of the Cold War . Erasing the differences still dividing Europe , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary . But it could ultimately %% lead %% to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map . Which is what the Old Guard fears . `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state , '' says Michael Simmons , a British journalist whose book on East Germany , entitled `` The Unloved Country , '' was published this month .
lead.v | 5 | The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio , Master Pictures Incorporated ( MPI ) . Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI , but before it can , a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter , the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency . The lowly agent , Abel Lamb , who as you might guess , is being %% led %% to the slaughter , is ordered to take over the studio . Soon the studio is producing a $ 40 million picture called `` Tet , the Motion Picture , '' to distinguish it from `` Tet , the Offensive , '' as well as `` Tet , the Book '' and `` Tet , the Album . '' The picture , to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador , is a cover for sending $ 800 million of arms to Los Otros , the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua , which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega , a former podiatrist , who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers .
lead.v | 4 | Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . `` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has %% led %% Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . `` The Americans have left him without a way out . It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
lead.v | 4 | Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration . They have also %% led %% the nation in the direction of a welfare state . And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South .
lead.v | 4 | This showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle . The misery of Miriam 's bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with Miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain . To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes %% led %% by Miriam in person . One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June . At this time Miriam Noel appeared , urging on Constable Henry Pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood .
lead.v | 1 | Like Roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him . He chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed . The very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact %% leads %% to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader . The capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader 's means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership . The making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business .
lead.v | 1 | The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( C ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank . These assumptions %% lead %% to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel . The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men . This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .
lead.v | 1 | The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union . Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action . Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it %% led %% to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century . Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty . The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .
lead.v | 1 | But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself . Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement . It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , %% leading %% to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground . This became a dance called Prelude To Flight . A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .
lead.v | 2 | It was called Kent House . The deacon of the church , Carlson , was its janitor . One of the %% leading %% members of the Amen corner was cook ; ; there were two or three colored maids employed there . Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather queer . Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom ? ?
lead.v | 4 | Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat . Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney . Mrs. Hewlitt %% led %% the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout . Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life .
lead.v | 3 | He had ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback . Now , driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . The road %% leading %% south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories . He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky 's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on . He would cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning .
lead.v | 5 | John stood above him , his face ashen . What now ? ? Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and %% led %% him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned . `` Plot '' ? ? John asked tiredly . `` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit .
lead.v | 5 | He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air . Gavin 's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words . When he had finished he %% led %% him and the mare to the porch . The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head . Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .
lead.v | 4 | Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century . He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's . %% Led %% by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him . Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
lead.v | 1 | What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor 's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification . She realized I 'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name . Her impact in the zing commercials had %% led %% to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits . But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits . Or at least not to Joyce .
lead.v | 5 | Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily . Greg went up tight against the ceiling and %% led %% them back to their pass to home . Mercifully , it was still open . Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .
lead.v | 3 | She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness . And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade %% leading %% toward them , Matilda could not speak at all . Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa ! !

Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos . Here they did not need to be in ghettos .
lead.v | 4 | Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way . As he %% leads %% the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor 's insistence . A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot . Not only was Haumd 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride .

The view of some others in Big Oil , he %% maintains %% , `` is very much { similar to } Amoco 's outlook . '' Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations . Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun .
maintain.v | 1 | That level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong , analysts said . But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that . Also , %% maintaining %% current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies . To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday 's trading , late October weather , especially in the Northeast U.S. , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster . `` We are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' Mr. Bolling said from New York .
maintain.v | 1 | Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs . To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : 1 . Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets , not to provide subsidies . There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and %% maintaining %% the integrity of a credit program . If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal . Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
maintain.v | 1 | The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo . Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year . The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , %% maintaining %% production of the two most important ones , corn and milk . Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods . The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale .
maintain.v | 1 | Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom %% maintain %% close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
maintain.v | 1 | In the case of Beatrice , Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million portion of the offering . Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys . Under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate to %% maintain %% a market value of 101 . Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 % . Mortgage-Backed Securities
maintain.v | 1 | The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages . The future of the forest remains uncertain . Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be %% maintained %% . After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment . They 're more worried about bread on the table .
maintain.v | 1 | Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean . That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- %% maintain %% radio contact with the outside world . In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door .
maintain.v | 1 | If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that . Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is %% maintained %% for 10 years . But Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies . And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
maintain.v | 1 | And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters . More enemies to be dealt with . In the two weeks since the rebellion , which the U.S. hesitantly backed , Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in %% maintaining %% power . Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades . America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship .
maintain.v | 2 | And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ; but many historians %% maintain %% that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .
maintain.v | 1 | `` It was then I knew that they were making war against Man , the individual within ! ! -- who questioned things when given orders '' . At Stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied German , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander . In secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners ' Central Committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and %% maintained %% a hidden control over the wretched French slave-laborers . In the Stalag , Helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other . How much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape .
maintain.v | 2 | Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never %% maintained %% that sex was all . Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .
maintain.v | 1 | To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth . So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend . It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln 's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to %% maintain %% the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union . They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves . The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .
maintain.v | 1 | It was , to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted . If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves . Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they %% maintained %% proficiency in their technical work . On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the A[fj] . Her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship .
management.n | 2 | Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ( $ 872 million ) , marking the bank 's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch . BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $ 3 billion without the Rome-based %% management %% 's approval . State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties . BNL also said that its board had approved `` after an in-depth discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches .
management.n | 2 | First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share . Secondly , the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications . Finally , Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller 's %% management %% beyond taking a place on the board . `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi . Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
management.n | 2 | Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record ? Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period ? Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for %% management %% to carry out this strategy ? If the answers to these questions are affirmative , then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill . However , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive forever .
management.n | 2 | At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders , who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time . One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco . Pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current %% management %% enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner . Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc. , a diversified holding company . The State of Wisconsin Investment Board , which owned about 7 % of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill .
management.n | 1 | The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities . As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant 's performance . In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the %% management %% of the plant 's operation . '' Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
management.n | 1 | In the August proxy material , Avery said that unless it sold Uniroyal , its ability to service debt would be hurt and Avery 's shareholder value would `` continue to erode . '' Until Avery makes an acquisition , Messrs. Peltz and May will waive their direct salaries and bonuses , the company said . For at least the next six months , however , Avery will continue to pay $ 200,000 a month for %% management %% services to a company controlled by Messrs. Peltz and May , according to the proxy material .
management.n | 2 | `` The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation '' in the paper industry , said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . `` I do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover , '' said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc. , Chicago . He added : `` Every paper company %% management %% has to be saying to itself , ` Before someone comes after me , I 'm going to go after somebody .

Mr. Wakeman , whom Chemical tried to keep , did n't return calls for comment . Separately , Chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on forward-rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in Frankfurt , West Germany .
management.n | 2 | The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment . Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender . Many analysts question %% management %% 's credibility . `` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but { because } the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth . Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down .
management.n | 2 | Mr. Bass is based in Fort Worth . Analysts said the nation 's second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes . Its problem , they say , is that %% management %% paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red . `` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland . In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs .
management.n | 1 | She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit . Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises , supporters wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today . `` There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher 's style of %% management %% has become a political liability , '' says Bill Martin , senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew . The prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community . Last week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up : Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters , the adviser , announced his resignation within an hour .
management.n | 2 | Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM\/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio . Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel . `` Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming %% management %% positions at Columbia , '' Mr. Guber says . Mr. Semel , in his affidavit , does n't mention any hugging or congratulating . He says he told Mr. Guber he could n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner . ''
management.n | 2 | Three years later , machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire . Once again the company 's future looked less than rosy . But after restructuring under new %% management %% , the profits began rolling in . A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks . They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad .
management.n | 2 | The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. 26 , but it does n't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date . In Delaware Chancery Court litigation , Telerate has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that Telerate 's management expects the company 's revenue to increase by 20 % annually , while Dow Jones based its projections of Telerate 's performance on a 12 % revenue growth forecast . In the tender offer supplement , Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate `` as a hoped-for goal '' of Telerate 's %% management %% `` and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance . '' Telerate shares fell 50 cents on Friday to close at $ 20 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . Dow Jones shares also fell 50 cents to close at $ 36.125 in Big Board composite trading .
management.n | 2 | Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' chairman , said he had n't yet seen the filing and could n't comment . DPC made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable . Dataproducts had sought a buyer for several months , but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and %% management %% says the company is no longer for sale .
management.n | 2 | On Wednesday , Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation . Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year . During the coming months , layers of %% management %% will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous . For greater efficiency , employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction , Mobil said . `` The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations , '' said Charles E. Spruell , president of the Mobil unit .
management.n | 1 | Late Thursday , the Treasury said it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week . Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management bills . Instead , the Treasury announced it would sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash %% management %% bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today , as usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday . By moving the settlement date ahead , the Treasury can raise money under the $ 2.87 trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow , after which it reverts to $ 2.8 trillion . The market also was hurt by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru , a Japanese brokerage firm , was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased .
management.n | 1 | Franklin is a closed-end management investment company . On the Nasdaq over-the-counter system , Allied Capital Corp. , Washington , D.C. , ( ALII ) began trading last Thursday .

management.n | 2 | However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said . In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy . `` A similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing %% managements %% , '' he said .
management.n | 2 | Now , at least some predictability has returned , for everyone from economists to motorists . Corporate planners can plan again . `` %% Management %% does n't want surprises , '' notes Jack Zaves , who , as fuel-services director at American Airlines , buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year . Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. Zaves gave up on long-term forecasts . And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds W. Henson Moore , U.S. deputy secretary of energy .
management.n | 2 | CMS ENERGY Corp. said %% management %% would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year . The Dearborn , Mich. , energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant . In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .
management.n | 2 | Merksamer Jewelers Inc. , a fast-growing jewelry store chain , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain . The filing , made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here , follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp. , Merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to %% management %% for an undisclosed price . GE Capital Corp. , a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , is providing Merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing . L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain .
management.n | 1 | He said that American Telephone & Telegraph , MCI Communications Corp. , Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital 's subcontractors on the project . `` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said Paul Allen , the spokesman . `` That 's why we went with IBM for data center %% management %% ... and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications .
management.n | 2 | Obviously not . Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand\/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating . The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when %% management %% embraces the employees ' perspective . A. Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla . I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others .
management.n | 2 | Campeau 's chairman , Robert Campeau , said at its annual meeting in July that he valued Bloomingdale 's at $ 2 billion . Among previously disclosed possible bidders is Bloomingdale 's Chairman Marvin Traub , who has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group . Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a %% management %% committee headed by Bloomingdale 's Mr. Traub .

'' Axa would also maintain Farmers ' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages .
management.n | 1 | These figures omit secondary guarantees , deposit insurance , and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises ( a huge concern in its own right , as detailed on this page May 3 ) . Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially . Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive %% management %% in particular . As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit . But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control .
management.n | 1 | Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired . Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money %% management %% unit 's contributions in recent years . In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million . Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
management.n | 2 | In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line . In September 1988 , Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc. , a closely held New York chain operated under the Bonds name . Eagle 's %% management %% retired and Biny 's management took control of the company . At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million . But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .
management.n | 2 | The %% management %% turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago . Mr. LaBonte 's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok . The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
management.n | 2 | MINORITY RECRUITING has yet to meet hopes raised by Bush administration . Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top %% management %% to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring .
management.n | 1 | The acquisition was completed in September . In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed . The delays mainly affected sales of data base %% management %% products , a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet , as well as sales of other products as part of package sales .
management.n | 2 | Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights . Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits . For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal 's Tiger problems , %% management %% believes . Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination . When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority .
management.n | 1 | The company will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with MGM\/UA and any loss from the investment in Qintex Entertainment , he said . Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest . Qintex Australia paid the %% management %% company A$ 32.6 million in the latest fiscal year . Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services . Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia , who must approve payments to the senior executives , balked at the amount .
management.n | 1 | Mr. Bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's %% management %% . `` It 's one of the best in the business , '' says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi . And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction-related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
management.n | 1 | Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the %% management %% contract . Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr .
management.n | 2 | UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now . As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company . The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a %% management %% scrambling to restore its damaged credibility . The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer . Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
management.n | 1 | N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed . WHO 'S NEWS : John Wells , 47 , former president and chief executive of N W Ayer 's Chicago office , was named %% management %% director and director of account services at WPP Group 's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago ... . Shelly Lazarus , 42 , was named president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct , the direct mail division of WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency .
management.n | 2 | In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . First Boston 's estimates had been higher before %% management %% supplied a 1989 projection . Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike . And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets , First Boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share .

Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding IT PAYS to follow a %% management %% career path -- even at law firms . That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant . Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years .

Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust , Boston , was listed with the symbol PGM . The new closed-end %% management %% investment company trades shares of beneficial interest . It invests primarily in tax-exempt municipal securities . Hibernia Corp. , a New Orleans bank holding company , will join the Big Board Thursday under HIB .
management.n | 1 | Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years . A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of the SEC 's division of investment %% management %% . So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
management.n | 2 | The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % . It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % . %% Management %% 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air . One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period . Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time .
management.n | 2 | When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy %% management %% consultants . `` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .

Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .
management.n | 2 | If the whole story were told , it would read something like this : -- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made . -- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings ( and %% management %% bonuses ) ; the price , a sea of bad loans . -- For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits . -- The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans ( the Brady Plan ) .
management.n | 1 | Marginal operations and assets have been sold . The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . About 140 salaried %% management %% jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated . Even perks have been reduced . For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
management.n | 2 | The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL %% management %% . British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier . The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
management.n | 1 | Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . `` There is n't a boatload { of big investors } out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active %% management %% services . ( After tripling in size in the past five years , index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds . ) A further problem is razor-thin profits .
management.n | 1 | `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study . `` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' While utilization %% management %% frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts . The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow . `` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said .
management.n | 1 | But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed . `` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. Bailit said . David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization %% management %% reduces their hospital care bills by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs . Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
management.n | 2 | UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase . Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake . UAL %% management %% was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake . The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing . Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
management.n | 2 | CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty . A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges . `` If it causes %% management %% to take their eye off the ball , inventory shrinkage is going to be affected , '' says Lewis Shealy , vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field 's , the department store chain .

A survey by Sirota , Alper & Pfau , a New York consulting firm , underscores the difficulty for top %% management %% in satisfying employees and investors on that score .

Mr. Ruby , 39 , said that he had `` an amicable parting '' with Capital Holding and that he has `` a number of ventures in the financial-services area '' under consideration . He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding %% management %% , but that he was n't actually asked to resign . The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding 's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions . It also sells single-premium annuities to individuals .

Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. , where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts . Commodore has assembled an experienced %% management %% team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign . But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones . In the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses .
management.n | 2 | `` We would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass , '' he said . One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is , give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments . That would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's %% management %% to reduce their level of ownership . `` The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through , '' said Peter C. Canellos , tax partner at Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz . Another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount .
management.n | 2 | Prospect Group Inc. , whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. failed for lack of financing , apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway . As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an `` amiable agreement , '' Prospect Group will wind up with control of top %% management %% posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment . In a management restructuring , Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman , chief executive and a director , while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director .

Japanese domestic institutions , including trust banks and investment %% management %% firms , that had been on the sidelines during Monday 's fall were back in the market , analysts said . Foreign investors reportedly started off selling but later joined in the buying . The Tokyo rally seemed to confirm the view , frequently expressed in Japan in the past few days , that the drop in New York was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. .

They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt , a bad trade all around . They believe microeconomics , which addresses the problems of markets , investment climate and %% management %% practices , is the key to developing-country growth , not the IMF 's Keynesian focus on trade deficits , quarterly targets and government debt . They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs . Decisions on increases in the IMF 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by Congress .

He said 13,000 more copies were sent to Estonia because of strong sales . The Swedish publishing company Bonniers owns 51 % of Are Paev , and the Estonian %% management %% company Minor owns 49 % . Angel Gurria , Mexico 's top debt negotiator , said the country 's creditor banks are responding positively to Mexico 's debt-reduction package .

Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater %% management %% equity participation . Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer .
management.n | 2 | To combat that problem , National Geographic , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets . But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors . Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top %% management %% , and other groups . Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do . And National Geographic 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers .

They have since mellowed , although one senior Young & Rubicam executive , echoing others , said : `` I think ad agencies owe Carl { Spielvogel } a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . '' But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd %% move %% for Backer Spielvogel , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi . Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including Nissan , Toyota , Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan .

So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France . The %% move %% also reflects Coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific Basin countries . Aside from Europe , the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come . That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine .
move.n | 2 | Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the %% move %% , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . '' Although GM has U.S. approval to buy up to 15 % of Jaguar 's stock , it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns . In a prepared statement , GM suggested its plans for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid .
move.n | 2 | Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith . The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 . Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' %% moves %% could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined . In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities . Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .
move.n | 2 | With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for UAL , the parent company of United Airlines , and AMR , the parent of American Airlines , analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market . The $ 3.18 billion bid , which had been rumored since last week , `` creates a better feeling that there 's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape , '' says A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research Corp . Traders and analysts alike said the market 's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of %% moves %% by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage . Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading , designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures . `` People are looking for an ability to try and read the market , rather than be manipulated , '' said Dudley A.

Allianz said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of Navigation Mixte , a diversified financial , transport and food holding company . The %% move %% comes a week after Paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7 % control of Navigation Mixte . Munich-based Allianz 's brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte . That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte .
move.n | 2 | The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans . The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status . In Dallas , LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the %% move %% will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings . The company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency . But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .

The %% move %% by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since October 1987 's stock market crash , the executive added . Quotron , which Citicorp purchased in 1986 , provides price quotations for securities , particularly stocks .

The ministry said the swap , details of which were disclosed last Thursday , will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the %% move %% shows the dynamism of France 's state-sector concerns . The approval also ends any hope that Banque Nationale de Paris , another state-sector bank , might have had about taking Credit Lyonnais 's place in the accord . It hinted over the weekend that it would have been interested in a hook-up with Thomson-CSF .

Dissidents in Czechoslovakia said the nation 's pro-democracy movement was growing despite the government 's %% move %% to crush a protest Saturday in Prague 's Wenceslas Square .

Cantor provides price quotes to Telerate Systems Inc. , a widely used electronic system . Nippon Kangyo 's %% moves %% puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors , many of whom decided to stay out of the market .

'' But Mr. Ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him , effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on NBC-TV 's `` Meet the Press '' that Mr. Ortega 's threat was `` a very unwise %% move %% , particularly the timing of it . '' The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America 's progress toward democracy in the region , attended by President Bush , Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders . Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night .

Bethlehem had little choice but to go with a European steelmaker , because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders , analysts noted .

The FCC %% moves %% were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation . Alfred Sikes , the new FCC chairman , championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency . But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .

After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall . Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its %% move %% as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992 . Yet the Rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision . In 1796 , Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century .

The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price . That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
move.n | 2 | `` There are an increasing number of people out there who are time-poor , '' said Chris Vroom , retail analyst with Alex . Brown & Sons of Baltimore . `` Those are primarily white-collar workers , a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores . '' National Convenience 's %% move %% is likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that Southland Corp. , owner of 7-Eleven stores , and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort . Still , Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has begun to follow suit . For instance , Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets .
move.n | 2 | Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C. ) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years . `` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee . The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) and Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy %% moves %% immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed . In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy . `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .
move.n | 2 | Last April , Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for C$ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates . Mr. Drabinsky , who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years , said the purchase , subsequently rejected by regulators , was aimed at consolidating his control of the company . MCA strongly opposed the Drabinsky group 's %% move %% . The directors did n't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky 's new proposal , but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ 57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City , Calif. , if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer . `` This is being done at the suggestion of { Mr. Drabinsky } and to accommodate him , to facilitate his financing arrangements , '' Ms. Kolber said .

But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the %% move %% will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units . `` It certainly was n't intended to be a demotion , '' the spokesman said . `` Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work .

A Lebanese Christian alliance accepted an Arab-sponsored proposal aimed at ending Lebanon 's 14-year-old civil war . The %% move %% by the coalition of political parties and Lebanon 's largest Christian militia isolated military chief Aoun , who has rejected the plan , which includes political changes and a Syrian troop withdrawal from Beirut . Baker offered to review Israel 's `` suggested changes '' to his proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks . But the secretary of state advised Israel that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at Mideast peace .
move.n | 2 | Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy . The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents . Several cotton analysts said that the %% move %% appeared to be mostly technical . Traders who had sold contracts earlier , in hopes of buying them back at lower prices , yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses . Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors , which have been circulating for the past two days , about China purchasing cotton .
move.n | 2 | Last year 's results were hurt by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges . National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring %% moves %% . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike .

Although the board believed that Mr. Icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring USX , it adopted a poison-pill defense , to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15 % stake . Now , it 's Mr. Icahn 's %% move %% . Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies ? Given the weakness of the junk-bond market , can he finance a buy-out ?

move.n | 2 | But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded . No human can examine millions of %% moves %% , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones . After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
move.n | 3 | After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly . Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on %% move %% 16 . `` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans . By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap .
move.n | 3 | `` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later . In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . '' After only 11 %% moves %% for each side , the computer 's position was shaky . Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack . And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
move.n | 3 | And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move . Now , after only a dozen %% moves %% , spectators were looking for a mating combination . On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
move.n | 2 | And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions . Some analysts speculated yesterday that the %% move %% has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the carrier 's chief executive officer . `` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said . `` There is no difference of opinion between ( Chairman ) Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy .
move.n | 2 | BSB BANCORP Inc. , Binghamton , N.Y. , said it increased its regular quarterly dividend 50 % , to 15 cents a share from 10 cents . It is payable Dec. 10 to stock of record Nov. 24 .

move.n | 2 | Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . Analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in Qintex Australia and force it to sell assets . The company 's latest %% moves %% were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment . Mr. Skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry . It said Qintex Entertainment owes Qintex Australia US$ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .

move.n | 2 | Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the %% move %% is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover . Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .

move.n | 2 | Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit . Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' %% move %% for me . Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing . And the Second Law , unique to insurance ?
move.n | 2 | `` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . '' Other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected . But whether such %% moves %% can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz . And that 's a problem . Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
move.n | 2 | Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months . `` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting %% move %% wo n't result in even greater earnings growth . `` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .

Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' The catalyst has been the congressional %% move %% to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes .
move.n | 2 | BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related %% move %% , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals . BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .

First City , which recently purchased three small Texas banking concerns , said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the Southwest and elsewhere . With that possibility in mind , analysts said the transaction was a positive %% move %% for First City . `` I think they 'll be able to move faster to make acquisitions in Texas , '' said Brent Erensel , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . `` That 's something they can do very well .
move.n | 2 | Baxter International Inc. , citing cost-cutting %% moves %% and increased sales of its home-care products and dialysis treatments , posted a 20 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 5.9 % sales boost .

Sales totaled $ 1.81 billion up from $ 1.71 billion the previous year .
move.n | 2 | Energy prices continued to fall at the retail level , but economists worried about a big rise in wholesale energy costs . British Airways dropped out of the current bidding for United Air 's parent , leaving a UAL management-pilots group without a key partner . British Air 's %% move %% raised new questions about the buy-out group 's efforts to revive a stalled bid for UAL . A capital-gains tax-cut plan was dropped by Senate Democrats under pressure from their leadership . The move is a setback for Bush , who needs Democratic support to pass a capital-gains cut in the Senate .
move.n | 2 | In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early %% move %% essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently . `` I did n't expect it to be this quiet . I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling , '' said Raymond F. DeVoe , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker , Baltimore .
move.n | 2 | Brokerage houses jumped in , touting `` post-quake demand '' stocks , and Kidder , Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds . `` Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money , '' says Tom Gallagher , a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader . However , he added , such event-driven trading %% moves %% typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information .

The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow .
move.n | 2 | Mr. Craven is widely credited with refocusing Morgan Grenfell 's energies on its core corporate finance , fund management and banking activities over the past year . Last year , Morgan Grenfell shut down its ailing U.K. securities operations . Mr. Craven said his %% move %% to the chairmanship means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group , but he added that the merchant bank 's strategic focus remains unchanged . Mr. Craven joined Morgan Grenfell as group chief executive in May 1987 , a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive Christopher Reeves and other top officials because of the merchant bank 's role in Guinness PLC 's controversial takeover of Distiller 's Co. in 1986 .

Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . The lightning %% moves %% show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues . The industrial average closed down 18.65 , to 2638.73 .

Scott Paper Co. said it is abandoning a proposed $ 650 million tree-farming project in Indonesia because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated . The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill , which would have covered about 175,000 acres in the Irian Jaya region , had been approved by Indonesia 's investment board .
move.n | 2 | Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence . In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates , the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system . But the Fed %% move %% was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline about one-quarter percentage point .
move.n | 2 | NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of `` Today , '' which is produced by NBC News .

But several weeks ago , in the wake of the Beijing killings , the loan was canceled , according to bankers and executives close to the project .

The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June 4 .

IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips . While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment %% needed %% to produce those chips . And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market .

Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies . Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday , Mr. Lawson said inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are %% needed %% '' to choke it off . The latest government figures said retail prices in September were up 7.6 % from a year earlier . Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year .
need.v | 1 | The hulk of Stalinism , it seems , will not quickly crumble away . State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them . Polish agriculture will %% need %% a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed . The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here . Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started .
need.v | 1 | The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount . High default rates , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high . Families that do not %% need %% the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates . In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates . While the student was in school , interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance .
need.v | 1 | Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions . Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt . It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't %% need %% brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states .
need.v | 2 | His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. . Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed . `` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity %% needed %% to reach the top , he said . The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T. 's strong points . Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
need.v | 1 | Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' They %% needed %% new crises to generate new grants and contracts . In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
need.v | 2 | -- Mimi Kay . Foresight We %% need %% to get a space platform set up soon -- just in case we want to step out for a breath of fresh air . -- Ivern Ball .
need.v | 1 | In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than %% needed %% . Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office . He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
need.v | 1 | And she has this inexhaustible energy . She 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . '' In fact , Ms. Volokh was n't just a rich lady who %% needed %% a hobby . Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia . Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` The Art of Russian Cuisine , '' brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co .
need.v | 2 | The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust . The trust , which owns 80 % of Manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims . When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will %% need %% to convert its Manville stock to cash . But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
need.v | 2 | Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring . Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to %% need %% to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 .
need.v | 1 | While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House . `` I think { Mr. Phillips } is going to need some help . I think they %% need %% creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co . Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year . `` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
need.v | 1 | The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors . `` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence . `` It %% needs %% more discipline . It needs to sort itself out . '' Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled investors ( some of them royal ) who , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies .
need.v | 2 | The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals . Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building . `` We %% need %% to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman . About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 .
need.v | 2 | Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain . And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . `` The intensive labor %% needed %% to manufacture furs { in the U.S. . } is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production . But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure . `` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
need.v | 1 | `` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm . `` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . '' They are obviously also more susceptible when they %% need %% money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses . `` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive . Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
need.v | 1 | To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt . It never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n't grow when you %% need %% them to . Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition . That 's the dilemma for today 's parent .
need.v | 1 | Not so Michigan . Its plan is set up as an independent agency . The state says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it %% needs %% . Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau . If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 , 1990 , here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale , Notre Dame and University of Minnesota .
need.v | 2 | This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' Rep. Ronnie Flippo ( D. , Ala. ) , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany %% needed %% to change . `` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz .
need.v | 2 | Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air . Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . They %% need %% only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . '' The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
need.v | 2 | By September , a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles , 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar . In the last few weeks , Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles , the bomber version of the An-12 , MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft , MiG-29s , which can outfly Pakistan 's U.S.-built F16s , and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers , which can outfly the MiG-29s . Moscow claims this is all %% needed %% to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance . It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts . But this is not the entire Afghan army , and it is no longer Kabul 's only military force .
need.v | 1 | Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea . The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country 's leader . A White House spokesman said that while Bush would n't alter a longstanding ban on such involvement , `` there 's a clarification %% needed %% '' on its interpretation . India 's Gandhi called for parliamentary elections next month . The balloting , considered a test for the prime minister and the ruling Congress ( I ) Party , comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption .
need.v | 1 | At age seventy-four , he became what he shyly terms a `` pupil '' of Andres Segovia , the great guitarist of the Western world . It is not easy to become Segovia 's pupil . One %% needs %% high talent . Segovia has written about Carl : `` His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them . I found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .
need.v | 1 | Its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself . It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse . He %% needs %% existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion . And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself . He must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .
need.v | 1 | The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders . Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely %% needed %% now . Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest . Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .
need.v | 1 | And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we can not regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is %% needed %% , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we can not regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs . We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .
need.v | 1 | `` No '' . `` Why not ? ? That 's what he %% needs %% , something warm to his skin , do n't he '' ? ? `` Not where he 's froze good . Heat 's bad for frostbite .
need.v | 2 | The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky . The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they %% needed %% to say no more . The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows . Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .
need.v | 2 | And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be . For instance -- what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other ? ? Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not %% need %% to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields . And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .
need.v | 2 | 5 the Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one-gee acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed of light . Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few %% needed %% to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor . Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years . Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others .
need.v | 1 | Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin . He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it . Only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he %% needed %% it . Fighting pleasure itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there . B'dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway .
need.v | 1 | Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight . Take the pistol . You might %% need %% it . We 'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more . I 'll stampede the rest of these horses so they ca n't chase you '' .
need.v | 1 | `` There 's the one who 's lucky '' ! ! The girl murmured harshly . Ben 's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , %% needing %% their comfort more than they needed his . It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man . He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .
need.v | 1 | A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning . Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way . The car was just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in Sante Fe -- on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately %% needed %% rescue . I tossed the bottle . High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof .
need.v | 1 | He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt . `` You and I have a little talking to do , Jess . You wo n't be %% needing %% this '' . He moved up and lifted Jess 's pistol out of its holster . `` Damn you , Adams '' -- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock .
need.v | 1 | Maybe she will then come to you . After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy . You need her even more than you %% need %% him '' . `` She wo n't change her mind '' , Brannon said . `` John Clayton will see to that '' .
need.v | 1 | There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief . But they were starting a new life . And they had almost everything they %% needed %% : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses . The land was n't all Wilson had expected of it . Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ; good grass , good water .
need.v | 1 | No clear motivation . So sorry . He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he %% needed %% the Martini Anne had waiting for him . But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .
need.v | 1 | She did n't even give me a chance to refuse . Well , there was n't any law that said I had to stay ! ! But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child %% needed %% her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk . So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment . After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited .
need.v | 2 | Look , I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck . Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg . He says you 're limping more than you %% need %% to '' . `` How does he know ? ? Big dumb nut .
need.v | 1 | Just figures out of a tribal folklore . Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ? ? Being a woman though , she would take only what she %% needed %% from church . It was too bad he was n't a Catholic himself . Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist .
need.v | 1 | Wales said , `` Of course they would . They are about to do so at any moment as it is . All that is %% needed %% is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead . As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed . We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
need.v | 1 | `` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients . It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre '' . `` Do you think we %% need %% a new Henry James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene '' ? ? He asked . `` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward '' ? ? `` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward .
need.v | 2 | `` Those are the things I can do , now that I 'm set up '' . `` I 've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . `` We wo n't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you do n't %% need %% to worry -- there 'll be plenty more '' . But the discussion was academic . Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink .
negotiate.v | 1 | Delmed Inc. 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent , Fresenius AG , a major Delmed holder that has been %% negotiating %% to acquire a controlling stake . In addition , Delmed , which makes and sells a dialysis solution used in treating kidney diseases , said negotiations about pricing had collapsed between it and a major distributor , National Medical Care Inc . Delmed said Robert S. Ehrlich resigned as chairman , president and chief executive .
negotiate.v | 1 | Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel , the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50 % foreign ownership . U.S. companies account for less than 8 % of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987 . But some U.S. companies are %% negotiating %% projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched . Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures . Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
negotiate.v | 1 | Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 . Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those %% negotiating %% ad packages with the Meredith group . Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction . The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
negotiate.v | 1 | When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later . Seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology . Seita and Matra currently are %% negotiating %% with city officials for the right to begin service . And Seita is considering further diversification . It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA .
negotiate.v | 1 | `` If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , '' Mr. Moss contends . Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was %% negotiating %% with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . `` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . `` The Americans have left him without a way out .
negotiate.v | 1 | Less dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers . He served as president of the Continental Congress . He played the leading role in %% negotiating %% the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America 's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period . As first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall . He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York .
network.n | 2 | The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups . In a planned protest against his appearance , several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program can not continue . The %% network %% must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige . The demonstrators have been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute . It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of `` chickens coming home to roost . ''
network.n | 3 | `` Seems to '' because it 's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll . Finally , he got help . Tymnet is a major %% network %% linking computers . One of its international specialists , Steve White , took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll 's hunt , ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany . The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess .
network.n | 2 | By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise , Wright and Tower , the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution ... . An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in , say , West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not . But nobody did such a piece , reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman 's duties as a congressman , the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a %% network %% . Ethicist Michael Josephson , in one of his institute 's recent publications on `` Journalism : In the Year 2000 '' : The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal , sensitive and intimate facts .
network.n | 3 | In Japan , those functions account for only about a third of the software market . Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the U.S. , are still more common in Japan than PCs . In the U.S. , one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of %% network %% . In Japan , about 1 % are linked . `` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says Roger J. Boisvert , who manages the integrated-technologies group in McKinsey & Co. 's Tokyo office .
network.n | 3 | Michael Rauch , an attorney for Dow Jones , defended the offer as adequate , based on what the company considers realistic projections of Telerate 's revenue growth , in the range of 12 % . He also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority that would justify such an injunction . Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic %% network %% . Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services .
network.n | 3 | Dow Jones has said it believes the $ 18-a-share price is fair to Telerate 's minority shareholders . Late last week , representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer , but those talks did n't result in any changes in the offer . Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic %% network %% . Dow Jones , which owns 67 % of Telerate , publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .
network.n | 2 | Last month , Whittle announced it had sold $ 150 million in advertising time on the network to national advertisers . Mr. Whittle Friday said several more advertisers have been added . Whittle is spending $ 150 million initially to launch the %% network %% . Installation of satellite dishes , TVs and videocassette equipment will cost the company about $ 20,000 per school , Mr. Whittle said .
network.n | 1 | A few months ago , Dentsu acquired 69 % of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars ( US$ 4.6 million ) . Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles . Now , the giant marketing company , which holds 25 % of Japan 's 4.4 trillion yen ( $ 30.96 billion ) advertising industry , is considering the acquisition of an advertising %% network %% in the U.S. or Europe . What is driving Dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe . `` If we do n't do something ... we wo n't be able to catch up with demand , '' says a Dentsu spokesman .
network.n | 2 | NBC 's re-creations are produced by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions , which also makes the successful prime-time NBC Entertainment series `` Unsolved Mysteries . '' The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless . News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the %% networks %% ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program . Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that . Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` A Current Affair , '' which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
network.n | 1 | The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition . But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 . The bank also says it 'll use its international %% network %% to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges .
network.n | 1 | In recent months , more than 25 agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful all last year , according to police and travel-agency groups . Most of the cases have been in California , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed . Los Angeles police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime %% network %% that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones . Already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world . So far , the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets , according to Airline Reporting Corp. , a ticket processing center .
network.n | 2 | The show also signals Mr. Vila 's return as a television celebrity . Earlier this year , public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements . With Mr. Vila as host , `` This Old House '' became one of the Public Broadcasting Service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the %% network %% 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers . But Home Depot Inc. , an Atlanta-based home center chain , objected when Mr. Vila started doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers , a New Jersey building supply company that competes with Home Depot in some markets . `` I 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said Mr. Vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` Home Again with Bob Vila .

AT&T said the products , unlike previous generations , will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards , which AT&T expects to be broadly adopted . Sonet , or synchronous optical %% network %% , products have more capacity than earlier models . `` These products are the heart of our transmission-product line , '' Mr. Buchner said . He declined to disclose specific prices , but said each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars .

A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of %% network %% sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc . J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' And the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
network.n | 2 | Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. Pilson says . But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30 % or 40 % larger than those CBS usually gets . Mr. Pilson says baseball and the Olympics may help CBS move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the %% network %% 's image . And the Winter Olympics will air during the February `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations . That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the Pilson plan .
network.n | 2 | Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts , by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime , cable-TV industry executives say . Time officials declined to comment . Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV %% networks %% to cable subscribers . Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment . Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships .
network.n | 2 | Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million . In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power . Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable %% networks %% MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite . Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business . Together , they control nearly 40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. ; Tele-Communications has a 21.8 % stake , while Time Warner has a 17.8 % stake .
network.n | 1 | The hulk of Stalinism , it seems , will not quickly crumble away . State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them . Polish agriculture will need a whole private %% network %% of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed . The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here . Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started .

Revenue eased 0.3 % to $ 3.45 billion from $ 3.46 billion . Last week , ABC unseated General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit as the No. 1 %% network %% , as rated by A.C. Nielsen Co . ABC has four shows in the top 10 , including the top show , `` Roseanne .

While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper . An attorney will be able to use the %% network %% for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities . Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection JAPAN 'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers .
network.n | 2 | Mr. Hogan said `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming '' and `` Treasure Island '' cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release . The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films . In July , Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime %% network %% and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters .
network.n | 1 | That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence . ( While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . ) Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency %% network %% : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , Jeep\/Eagle and Dow Brands . Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own .
network.n | 3 | Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said . Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a %% network %% of many terminals ( a role usually filled by a minicomputer ) , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer . `` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said . He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
network.n | 3 | If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a %% network %% to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
network.n | 3 | Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines . The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a %% network %% for simultaneous processing . But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .

'' Geoffrey Goodfellow , who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm , says : `` Old %% network %% hands have started to turn off the network because they do n't have time to wade through the muck . '' Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park , Calif. , company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks . `` I see it as a sewage treatment plant , '' he says .
network.n | 3 | Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night . Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically . So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer %% networks %% . `` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem . Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
network.n | 1 | Last year , Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice , more than 10 % of the country 's output . The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses . A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail %% network %% . In recent years , Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company , taking a 20 % stake in newly established , partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank , and setting up Saigon Petro , which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery . Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about $ 2.7 million on sales of $ 150 million .
network.n | 2 | As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments . `` In terms of coverage , it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes , '' said Eric Premner , president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. , which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle , Wash . While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the %% network %% was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake . `` I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster , '' said Mr. Premner . `` So before I start to be really critical of NBC , I would like to know more about what happened . ''
network.n | 3 | Michael L. Bandler , vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . The battery packs have enough power for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's %% network %% , only four went down . One of those was in Hollister , Calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter . Few telephone lines snapped .

Olsen , Digital 's president . He says Digital will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing , which includes retail-sales tracking , airline reservations and bank-teller %% networks %% . Tandem , which already specializes in on-line transaction processing , is a potent competitor in that market . A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems .
network.n | 2 | The National Broadcasting Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , had its record-breaking 68-week reign as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by ABC-TV , a subsidiary of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc . In the ratings compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. , ABC , which broadcast the World Series , topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share . NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc. 's television %% network %% with a 12.5 rating and 21 share . ( A ratings point represents 904,000 television households ; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use . ) The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants did n't finish in the top 10 ; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place .
network.n | 3 | The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe , which is to be launched today . Charles Redmond , a NASA spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer %% networks %% collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today . Although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn . Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . ''
network.n | 3 | He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system . The intruder , among the broadest yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital 's VAX\/VMS operating system . It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet , a much larger %% network %% used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world . In the lingo of computer security , the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm , Mr. Redmond said . A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks .
network.n | 2 | Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season . '' He declined to elaborate . NBC 's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows , although the %% network %% declined to comment . One major NBC affiliate , KCRA in Sacramento , plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast . The one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings .
network.n | 2 | An NBC spokesman says the network will `` closely monitor '' the Sacramento situation , and says it is the only station to defect . Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , say there are no plans to alter the children 's line-up on Saturday mornings . The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the %% networks %% . There has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations , as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel . At the same time , there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming ; Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings , outside of prime time , on Saturday mornings .
network.n | 2 | The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call .

The South Atlantic States were the only region to report an increase in bankruptcies , up 5.3 % to 5,791 from 5,502 . This %% occurred %% partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged . The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance , insurance and real-estate sector , where bankruptcies grew 8.1 % to 2,046 from 1,892 . The troubled savings-and-loan industry and subsequent stress in real-estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector , D&B said .

At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails . But U.S. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah , the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories , which the U.S. does n't classify as terrorism .

Now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high . The discounting , say fast-food operators , %% occurs %% on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .

To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person . One of the most distressing of these scenes %% occurred %% at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June . At this time Miriam Noel appeared , urging on Constable Henry Pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood .

With regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ? A number of considerations suggest that this %% occurs %% early in the process . Change involves the displacement of form . This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .
occur.v | 1 | For better or worse we can not regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we can not regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it %% occurs %% . We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .

All orders-related components , such as consumer-goods %% orders %% and building permits , are thought to have been weaker . Data Resources ' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales . Usually , October `` is n't a very interesting month { for retail figures } because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents , '' he said .
order.n | 1 | Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets . More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution . They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every %% order %% , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . '' This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . ''
order.n | 6 | Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer %% orders %% are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .

Under the rescue plan , Waertsilae sold 51 % of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds . The government , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the %% order %% backlog and took control of the board . Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure Finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation . The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute .

Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the %% order %% of 1 % or 2 % a year .

The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week , with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who developed the system . In Frankfurt , which only has a two-hour daily stock-trading session even in the best of times , stocks did n't open for the first 45 minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell %% orders %% from small investors . As banks processed six-foot telexes of sell orders , the crush led to Manic Monday 's worst decline : German stocks ended down 13 % . Exchange officials extended trading hours , 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday , to clear up order backlogs .

In France , more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks -- including such giants as BSN and Elf Aquitaine -- did n't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day , traders say . The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy %% orders %% , solving an order-imbalance problem . But by that time , many big institutions had switched business to London . `` Belgium was closed for two days , France closed for a couple of hours , Germany was stuck .
order.n | 1 | The 1974 budget `` reform , '' passed over President Nixon 's veto , took away the presidential impoundment power , thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto . Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop . Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` %% order %% , resolution or vote '' or anything else , Presidents must have the chance to veto . Labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca n't deprive the President of his power to veto items . Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible .
order.n | 6 | But James Ireland , a Miami-based technical analyst with Avmark Inc. , an aircraft evaluation firm , estimated the total `` half-life '' value of the 15 planes at about $ 650 million or more . Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell , beginning in 1992 , have a current half-life value of about $ 34 million each , or a total $ 374 million , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ 1.02 billion . Mr. Ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong , partly because surging %% orders %% for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists . He predicted that PWA would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers . Under its revised fleet plan , PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year .

The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost %% orders %% following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike .

order.n | 6 | Britain 's current account deficit dropped to # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.56 billion ) in September from an adjusted # 2 billion ( $ 3.21 billion ) the previous month , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year . The Confederation of British Industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown , largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to 15 % . `` The outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with %% orders %% and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said David Wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee . He also said investment by businesses is falling off . Of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more .

And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open .

The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week . They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court %% orders %% seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial . But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .

Cray said its order backlog at Sept. 30 was $ 315 million , down $ 25 million from June 30 . Marcello Gumucio , president , said the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing %% orders %% . '' As for the current period , Mr. Gumucio said , `` We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when Cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share . He added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . ''
order.n | 1 | The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases . A related editorial appears today . Under { RICO } , the government may seek a temporary restraining %% order %% ( TRO ) upon the filing of a RICO indictment , in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered . Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants , including clients , vendors , banks , investors , creditors , dependents , and others . Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process .
order.n | 6 | New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of %% orders %% for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported . Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department said . Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August .

She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the %% orders %% total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .

Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense %% orders %% . Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % . Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
order.n | 6 | Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping . Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1\/2 years in August . In July unfilled %% orders %% grew 1 % . But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . `` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going .
order.n | 6 | Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months %% orders %% would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year . Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector . Now at least there are question marks about that , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .
order.n | 6 | A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall . That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts say they think durable goods %% orders %% fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout .
order.n | 6 | General Motors continued to be hardest hit . Durable goods orders slipped 0.1 % in September , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models . Excluding transportation items , %% orders %% rose 1.8 % . Norfolk Southern 's board approved a buy-back of up to 45 million shares , valued at over $ 1.7 billion . The repurchase , coupled with an earlier buyback , will reduce the firm 's shares outstanding by over 26 % .

At about 10:40 a.m. EDT , several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks . `` It is very clear that those buy %% orders %% came from people who wanted their franchise protected , '' said one Chicago-based futures trader . `` These guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are . '' Traders said Goldman Sachs , Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment .
order.n | 6 | Traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a Japanese buy program that PaineWebber carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report . Dow Jones climbed 5 3\/4 to 41 on very heavy volume of 786,100 shares . Analysts said a big Japanese buy %% order %% was behind the rise . A Dow Jones spokesman said there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity . Other issues said to be included in the buy program were Procter & Gamble , which rose 2 7\/8 to 133 1\/2 ; Atlantic Richfield , which gained 2 to 103 3\/4 , and Rockwell International , which jumped 2 3\/4 to 27 1\/8 .
order.n | 6 | Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders . More stop-loss %% orders %% were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year . She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range .

order.n | 6 | Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report . The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2 % drop in September %% orders %% . That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August . Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower .
order.n | 1 | CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup . The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point . `` The interpretation '' of the executive %% order %% , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . '' In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA . The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
order.n | 1 | The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed . In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility . The executive %% order %% and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral . As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi . It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal .

At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months . `` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says .
order.n | 6 | Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 . ( Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . ) Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of %% orders %% to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit . By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said . In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .
order.n | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under %% orders %% to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .
order.n | 6 | One troubling aspect of DEC 's results , analysts said , was its performance in Europe . DEC said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter . It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that %% orders %% in Europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms . That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms , well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % , reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds . `` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said .
order.n | 6 | There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing . So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges . Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of %% order %% . And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions .
order.n | 6 | With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market %% order %% to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .

Limit Order : Limit %% orders %% are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
order.n | 6 | Unless the market goes at least one tick ( the smallest price increment permitted ) beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price . Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . Once the price reaches that level , a stop %% order %% turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .

Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .

order.n | 6 | Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the %% order %% is automatically canceled . Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says .

It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting . Not-held %% orders %% , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order . In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .

Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time . `` On the close '' can be added to many types of %% orders %% . For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .

Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .

Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit %% orders %% '' and then forgetting about them . They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel . It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
order.n | 6 | The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss %% orders %% under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
order.n | 1 | The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . Though the assassination ban is a White House %% order %% that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups . The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action .
order.n | 4 | His steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney . `` We have the structure , people and plan , '' Mr. Isler said in a statement . Now , the first %% order %% of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $ 3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a Cup challenge . The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull . In September , a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
order.n | 6 | But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much . Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut %% orders %% for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December . For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
order.n | 6 | Panic frequently results in irrational behavior . And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe . When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell %% orders %% at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
order.n | 6 | In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Inland closed yesterday at $ 35.875 a share , down $ 1 . The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector . However , the company also lost %% orders %% because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter . Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period , and 17 % from this year 's second quarter . Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ 26 a ton , from $ 66 a ton a year earlier and $ 57 a ton a quarter earlier .
order.n | 1 | In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new %% order %% has n't arrived without resistance . Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations . Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners .
order.n | 6 | But Mr. Keller said that , if computers can be integrated into the process , they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred . They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene . The computer would let the machine run just until that %% order %% was filled , eliminating waste . This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies . Companies might be able to tell salespeople daily , for instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces .
order.n | 6 | The order is the biggest in the company 's history . Sales in the latest period edged up to $ 295.7 million from $ 293.9 million . Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in %% orders %% `` puts us well on the way to our goal of $ 1.6 billion in bookings for the year . '' He added : `` I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year . '' Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .

order.n | 6 | Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls . `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said Navin Vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily volume of about 10 million shares . Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting %% orders %% to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles , `` business is as usual '' Mr. Vyas said . `` If one city is down , the other can take over . '' Meanwhile , the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope .
order.n | 6 | Northrop 's interest expense also soared to $ 35 million from $ 17 million a year ago . It said debt remained at the $ 1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989 , although that compared with $ 911 million at Sept. 30 , 1988 . The backlog of undelivered %% orders %% at Northrop on Sept. 30 was $ 4.68 billion , down from $ 5.16 billion a year earlier . For the nine months , Northrop reported a net loss of $ 46.9 million , or $ 1 a share , compared with profit of $ 190.3 million , or $ 4.05 a share , in 1988 . Sales dipped 3.6 % to $ 3.92 billion from $ 4.07 billion .
order.n | 6 | Japanese machinery makers received orders totaling 1.465 trillion yen ( $ 10.33 billion ) in August , up 14 % from a year earlier , the Economic Planning Agency said . `` Equipment %% orders %% on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and power utilities , '' said an agency official . The latest report compares with a modest 9.9 % increase in July machinery orders from a year earlier .
order.n | 1 | Under the law , Gramm-Rudman 's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent . Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted . However , the Associated Press 's account of the Monday sequester %% order %% signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment : `` Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill . '' Mr. Darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater :
order.n | 6 | The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer . Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988 . The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain %% orders %% in cooperation with another trader , David Stein . The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years . Also , he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $ 35,000 to a customer .
order.n | 6 | `` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros . '' Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market . The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the %% order %% , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says Stephen Boesel , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund . And assuming their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains . That can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. Lipper says .
order.n | 6 | Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m . As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders . Many funds allow investors to void %% orders %% before the close of trading . At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches . Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put .
order.n | 1 | Sony Corp. won a pretrial order blocking U.S. sales of Justin Products Inc. 's `` My Own '' line of portable audio players for children . Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the %% order %% in Manhattan federal court , where Sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the `` My First Sony '' line . The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law , rather than federal law . The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday .
order.n | 6 | While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer %% orders %% . The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration .
part.n | 1 | Excerpts follow : On China 's turmoil : `` It is a very unhappy scene , '' he said . `` It took Zhao Ziyang ( former premier and party chief ) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile , %% part %% being rusticated and part missing . '' Rebuilding that team , Mr. Lee predicted , will take another 10 years . `` That 's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth , not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan , Korea and the rest of Asia . ''
part.n | 1 | It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan . The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract . The clause was %% part %% of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise . Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern , some Machinists union supervisors received a 20 % pay raise . The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them .

If a new person got to work on %% part %% of the speedometer , that was a big deal . '' This system produced boring , boxy cars that consumers just were n't buying . Desperately hoping to spark sales , Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships .
part.n | 1 | Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets , he says . Borden even tested a milk with 4 % butterfat in the South , but decided the market was too small . Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and %% parts %% of New Jersey . And it 's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says Greg Ricca , sales director at La Lecheria . Because of Leche Fresca 's success , he says , the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes .
part.n | 2 | That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government-business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties . Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's Mitsubishi group . It 's known for its cautiousness in %% part %% because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures : In the year ended March 31 , 57.4 % of its total revenue came from office building management . Its earnings can rise 10 % to 12 % annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases , says Graeme McDonald , an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd . For the latest fiscal year , the company 's net income jumped a robust 19 % to 35.5 billion yen ( $ 250.2 million ) .
part.n | 1 | When Mr. Green won a $ 240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in June 1983 , he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $ 100,000 . Mr. Green thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback . `` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or %% part %% of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. Green said the judge asked him . Appalled , Mr. Green never paid the money , he testified . But he did n't complain to the state 's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
part.n | 1 | At that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines . `` In the price range it 's a tremendously high-performing product , '' said Sandy Gant , an analyst at the market-research firm InfoCorp . The machine is %% part %% of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of integrated-circuit technology . Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications . `` This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company , '' said Mips Vice President John Hime .
part.n | 1 | `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains . That 's because the male %% part %% , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants .
part.n | 1 | The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years , with the final scheduled payment in October , 2001 . First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter . As %% part %% of the transaction , J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit , which will then transfer them to a master trust . The trust will issue the certificates . Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee , Fuji Bank & Trust Co. , for the benefit of the certificate holders .
part.n | 1 | This , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written . My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited . When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs , the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important %% part %% of the CFC substitution scenario . Subsequently , I have learned that a private group , of which Du Pont is a part , is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments . But this is almost an underground activity .
part.n | 1 | Terms were n't disclosed , but industry executives said the units were sold for $ 40 million . Arthur H. Rosenfeld , previously president of the Prentice Hall Tax and Professional Services division , was named president of the newly formed Macmillan Professional and Business Reference division . Simon & Schuster retains the Corporation Law looseleaf service , which will become %% part %% of its Prentice Hall Law & Business unit .
part.n | 2 | The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser . Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year . The company attributed the decrease in %% part %% to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts . U.K. sales for last year 's quarter were about $ 3 million .
part.n | 1 | He called the sour loans `` appalling '' and added , `` You opened the file up and it just jumped at you . '' Leonard Bickwit , a Washington attorney for Lincoln 's parent corporation , said in an interview , `` We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers . '' `` Those who testified { yesterday } have consistently maintained that anyone who did n't agree with them is %% part %% of a coverup , a whitewash , or the subject of excessive influence , '' Mr. Bickwit said . `` We simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation . '' Mr. Wall 's deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee 's hearings , which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D. , Texas ) has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job .
part.n | 1 | More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act . This week , a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses : the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects . The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only %% part %% of the problem -- and a part that 's gone . `` If HUD is to be reformed , '' it concluded , Members of Congress will `` have to start looking into , and doing something about , the practices of their colleagues . '' Of course , self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in .
part.n | 1 | All four demonstrators were arrested . The law , which Bush allowed to take effect without his signature , went into force Friday . Chinese officials said armed police would replace soldiers in Tiananmen Square as %% part %% of a scaling down of Beijing 's five-month-old state of emergency . Separately , the U.S. Embassy has filed three protests in as many days with China 's government , alleging harassment of diplomats and their families , an embassy source said . Authorities in Algeria said the toll from two earthquakes Sunday had reached at least 30 dead and about 250 injured .
part.n | 1 | Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff , president of its CBS Records unit , said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement . Wayne Smith , an attorney at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony , said the Sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time . '' Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't %% part %% of the negotiations between Sony and the duo . Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up . But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio .
part.n | 1 | He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $ 45,000 . Authorities at London 's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor , `` Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo , '' that has two sketches on its verso ( opposite ) side . Valued at $ 1.3 million , it was %% part %% of a four-crate shipment . The air-waybill number was changed en route , and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced , so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing . Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time , the Gauguin may be `` lost . ''
part.n | 1 | Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion . It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration 's approval for a new drug , and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ 30 million to $ 70 million . The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as %% part %% of its $ 8 million contraceptive program . But the Population Council , a 37-year-old , $ 20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives , has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer , Roussel-Uclaf , a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government . In the year since the pill went on the French market , the National Organization for Women and its offshoot , former NOW President Eleanor Smeal 's Fund for a Feminist Majority , have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .
part.n | 1 | Why , a Bob Gates might even have said , `` Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits . '' If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things , we would now be hearing about `` discord '' and `` disarray '' on foreign policy . Dark hints would be raised that %% parts %% of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail , just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments . It 's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself , however , to say all the same things . In fact , he did ; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker 's speech of two weeks ago .

part.n | 2 | Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator , Manuel Noriega , if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life . The president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive . Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren ( D. , Okla . ) and Vice Chairman William Cohen ( R. , Maine ) , for their %% part %% , angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega . The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities . Instead , Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear they respected Congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen to iron out their differences .
part.n | 1 | Dozens of Guber-Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a `` daily basis , '' the attorney says . Mr. Guber , in his affidavit , says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 , Mr. Semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company . '' Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy %% part %% of MGM\/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio . Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel . `` Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia , '' Mr. Guber says .
part.n | 2 | Werner K. Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly . And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire . He achieved this in %% part %% with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies . His latest coup : September 's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc ( $ 3.07 billion ) merger between Adia S.A. , the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency , and Inspectorate International S.A. , a Rey-controlled product-inspection company . Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November .
part.n | 1 | The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December . The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers . The sale , which had been expected , is %% part %% of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February . Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit . That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .
part.n | 1 | General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $ 178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp. , 74%-owned by Leucadia , the sellers said . The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services , Chicago , a major owner of railway equipment and %% part %% of the GE Capital operations . Leucadia , New York , estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $ 57 million , including its part of Brae 's gain .

The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added . %% Part %% of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it . TransCanada is 49.1 % owned by Montreal-based holding company BCE Inc .
part.n | 1 | Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan ( U.S. naval officer and naval historian ) and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom . Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force ( the carrier fleet ) and its own army ( the Marines ) , which in turn has its own air force . Of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but Mr. Lehman seems to be %% part %% of the problem rather than part of the answer . L.H. Blum Beaumont , Texas I agree with Mr. Lehman 100 % !
part.n | 1 | Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old . Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . Most of the land in that and other %% parts %% of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .
part.n | 1 | Insurers could see claims totaling nearly $ 1 billion from the San Francisco earthquake , far less than the $ 4 billion from Hurricane Hugo . Nashua strengthened its poison-pill plan after announcing a Dutch firm is seeking to buy up to 25 % of the New Hampshire copier company .

part.n | 1 | While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers . The introductions also mark Texas Instruments ' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years . Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first %% part %% of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability . It stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago . Now that is about to change , as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives .
part.n | 1 | Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month ; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed . Still to come are big issues by Bindal Agro Chem Ltd. , a petrochemical and agrochemical company , and Usha Rectifier Corp . ( India ) , a semiconductor maker . While many investors are selling %% parts %% of their portfolios to buy the new issues , prices on India 's 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far . `` I do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market , '' says Mr. Patel , `` only a sagging tendency . '' Says M.J. Pherwani , chairman of the Unit Trust of India : The `` markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before . ''
part.n | 1 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important %% parts %% of the system it sets out to preserve . The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated . These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .
part.n | 2 | As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know , there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to `` encourage '' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed obsession with the short term . Now , we regard this as a largely phony issue , but the `` long term '' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway . It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large %% part %% because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value . They could no longer be classified as what Columbia regarded them , namely long-term investments . Congress 's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies ' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services .
part.n | 1 | The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer . ( A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , 32-bit chips . ) Since then , Intel has cornered a large %% part %% of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models . That 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs . Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are expected to reach the market early next year .
part.n | 1 | However , the company 's petroleum services segment , while profitable , was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a 50 % stake in Eastman Christensen Co. from Texas Eastern Corp. last June . Norton and Texas Eastern had each held a 50 % stake in Eastman in a joint venture . Norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or %% part %% of Eastman Christensen . For the nine months , Norton had net of $ 81.2 million , or $ 3.87 a share , and a tax credit of $ 4.4 million . In the year-earlier period , the company had net of $ 77.2 million , or $ 3.68 a share , and a tax credit of $ 7.7 million .

part.n | 1 | Poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself , under a June agreement with a dissident-shareholder group . The bank also said its effort would continue past the Nov. 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result . The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as %% part %% of the agreement .
part.n | 1 | In recent months , more than 25 agencies have been robbed , compared with only a handful all last year , according to police and travel-agency groups . Most of the cases have been in California , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed . Los Angeles police say the thieves seem to be %% part %% of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones . Already , the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world . So far , the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets , according to Airline Reporting Corp. , a ticket processing center .
part.n | 1 | Black & Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to Orkem S.A. , a French chemical company , for $ 345 million . Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as %% part %% of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year . Black & Decker said it plans to put other Emhart units on the block in the future , with the goal of raising $ 1 billion in net proceeds . Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion .
part.n | 1 | I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell 's exchange with a Gosbank representative ( `` Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails , '' editorial page , Oct. 5 ) with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research . Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . '' During the latter %% part %% of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles . The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world . The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .
part.n | 1 | National Convenience Stores Inc. , trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business , said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores . As %% part %% of the plan , the Houston-based company 's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black , Hispanic , upscale or core middle-class customers . Stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such as Vanity Fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products . Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines , Mexican cooking items and candies .
part.n | 1 | General Motors Corp. is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years , and it includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood-grain side panels . Ford and Chrysler also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section . `` We 've got to get out of the Detroit mentality and be %% part %% of the world mentality , '' declares Charles M. Jordan , GM 's vice president for design , in explaining his pilgrimage to the Tokyo Show . Even so , traditional American cockiness is n't terribly endangered . Ford officials , for example , crowed about their first-ever Tokyo Grand Prix racing victory .
part.n | 1 | Ms. Kolber said the committee had received other bids . She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky 's offer `` is all cash , and it 's for all of the company . '' Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only %% part %% of the company . `` All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out , '' said Jeffery Logsdon , an analyst with Crowell , Weedon in Los Angeles . `` If a bid materializes at that price , shareholders will have every reason to be glad , but the question of financing still remains . ''

Mr. Taylor also was named a director , increasing the board to 22 , but is not %% part %% of the new office of the chairman . James E. Bacon , 58 , executive vice president , who has directed the funds-service group , will retire .
part.n | 1 | And it is how African-Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation . For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities , the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece . Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a %% part %% of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act . The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector . Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act .
part.n | 1 | Judge Merhige is overseeing the bankruptcy-law reorganization of A.H. Robins Co. , the company that manufactured the shield . In a letter Monday to Mr. Saltzburg , the judge said he would `` reluctantly '' accept the resignation . The $ 2.38 billion Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust was established as %% part %% of A.H. Robins ' bankruptcy-reorganization plan to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield . American Home Products Corp. proposes to acquire the company . The remaining four trustees on the Claimants Trust have 60 days to nominate a successor to Mr. Saltzburg .
part.n | 1 | The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors . Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape . Secondly , critics have charged AZT 's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small %% part %% of the large and lucrative market . Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier for youngsters to take . Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills .
part.n | 1 | Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt . The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40 % rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989 , excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests . Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two %% parts %% and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ( $ 325 million ) . This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG . The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50 % stake , also from Beghin-Say .
part.n | 1 | While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips . And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other %% parts %% of the market . IBM also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing . IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques .
part.n | 1 | Indeed , Mr. Corry , at an August press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . '' However , shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas : Having two major products would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings . As Mr. Roderick once said : `` We 're a two-product company and , boy , if you ca n't figure out the value of those two %% parts %% , you are so damn dumb that you do n't belong on Wall Street . '' Moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone , for now . `` The time has passed for us to spin off steel , '' either in a public offering or to a buyer , one executive contends .
part.n | 1 | They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws . Sen. Alan Dixon ( D , Ill. ) , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , `` I 'm not a statistician . But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities , it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is %% part %% of the problem . '' James Grohl , a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions , said , `` The data is a red flag , but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . '' The trade group official added : `` Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it . ''
part.n | 1 | Indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche . The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other . Ms. Bogart 's cast is %% part %% and parcel of the problem . Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna . Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended .
part.n | 1 | Employees have n't yet been notified . Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver . This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil , which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15 % to 20 % during the mid-1980s as %% part %% of an industrywide shakeout . Mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations . In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations .
part.n | 1 | As of June 30 , it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ 136 million , a large portion of its $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities . Since most of its assets are tied to Manville , a forest and building products concern , the trust might also want to diversify its holdings . As %% part %% of its offer , Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to `` reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure . '' A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes . But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .
part.n | 1 | Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially . Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and policy applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular . As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as %% part %% of the federal deficit . But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control . Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement .
part.n | 2 | Still , analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term . `` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp . That is in %% part %% because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said . In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income . Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said .
part.n | 1 | `` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said . That total would be important for Drexel . The investment bank has previously announced that as %% part %% of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
part.n | 1 | As %% part %% of a previously announced transaction , Federal Mogul Corp. has bought approximately 565,000 shares of its common stock from Nortek Inc. at $ 23.50 a share . Nortek has agreed not to acquire any securities of Federal-Mogul for 10 years and not to influence company affairs during that period .
part.n | 1 | The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns . Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide . Council member Joy Picus , the measure 's chief advocate , considers it %% part %% of a `` pro-family policy '' that makes Los Angeles a leader in `` humanizing the workplace . '' NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business . In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business .
part.n | 1 | Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . `` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia . A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been %% part %% of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe . Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law . British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles .
part.n | 1 | The acquisition was completed in September . In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed . The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products , a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet , as well as sales of other products as %% part %% of package sales .
part.n | 2 | In this week 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility ( a la Rocky Flats ) . Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary ( Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest ) , a scheming young boss ( Fredric Lehne ) , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer ( Lindsay Frost ) , and a forensics expert ( Charles Siebert ) . If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in %% part %% by some tricky plot twists : The usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime . ( In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . )
part.n | 1 | Later this season he gives a recital at Washington 's Kennedy Center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras . Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries . During the late 1970s , he was %% part %% of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay . His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition . `` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. McDuffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl .
part.n | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As %% part %% of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
part.n | 1 | They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said . `` That means that if the offense deals with one %% part %% of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
part.n | 1 | In Tokyo , the Nikkei index added 99.14 to 35585.52 . The index moved above 35670 at midmorning , nearly reaching the record of 35689.98 set Sept. 28 . But the market lost %% part %% of the early gains on index-linked investment trust fund selling . In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday , the Nikkei index rose 1.08 points to 35586.60 . On Monday , traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei 's fast-paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in New York stock prices .
part.n | 1 | Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities . %% Part %% of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts . Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks . In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
part.n | 1 | DIET COKE : Coca-Cola Co. yesterday said singer Elton John signed to appear in an ad for Diet Coke . Details of the commercial , which will be %% part %% of the brand 's 1990 advertising campaign , were n't disclosed . Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars , including George Michael and Whitney Houston , to appear in ads for the diet drink .
part.n | 1 | A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing %% parts %% of the Houston Ship Channel . There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night . The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air .
part.n | 1 | It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment . They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore . Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known %% part %% of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere . Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper . Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .
part.n | 1 | Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots . The deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so many moving parts . I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving %% parts %% stop moving . '' In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt . In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding .
part.n | 2 | Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their %% part %% , are satisfied with the police response they receive . Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses . But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
part.n | 2 | Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit . When First Interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million . `` At that point , { First Interstate } decided it was the better %% part %% of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks . Thomas P. Marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations . He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . ''
part.n | 1 | There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal . Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important %% part %% of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
part.n | 2 | He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico , where the Cowboys have a following , to pick up the games . Mr. Jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days . He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his %% part %% in the bidding wars . Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract , Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years .

part.n | 1 | And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . `` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs { in the U.S. . } is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production . But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing %% part %% of their allure . `` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago . `` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. Purnick , the New York furrier .
part.n | 1 | The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are %% part %% of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
part.n | 1 | Personal space ( Figure 3 ) has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day . The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms ( Figure 4 ) has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for my record collection , whose worth , I think it 's safe to say , is incalculable . Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been %% part %% of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market ( Figure 6 ) , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .

part.n | 1 | Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 ( $ 4.48 ) to SKr205 ( $ 31.65 ) in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm . Tuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 . Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking %% parts %% of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price . Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units . The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
part.n | 1 | Winners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged . With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal . The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered %% part %% of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .

part.n | 1 | In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans , Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving , Texas . Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan . As %% part %% of the agreement , Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $ 25 million to the assets of Independent American . While under the control of federal regulators , Independent American 's net worth dropped from $ 75 million to a negative $ 400 million , wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution . Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act , which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees .
part.n | 1 | Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $ 75 million stock-for-debt exchange . The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal . As %% part %% of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face value of debt . However , that figure could be revised , Financial Corp. said . Currently , the company has about six million common shares outstanding .

part.n | 1 | The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . As %% part %% of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor ( D. , Ark . ) calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . To be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .
part.n | 2 | Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 . Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board . Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in %% part %% because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period . Sales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's international\/diversified operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period . For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period .
part.n | 1 | The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof . The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza . As %% part %% of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash . Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations . He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million .
part.n | 1 | `` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and { Chicago & North Western } is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp . Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals . Dan Baldwin , managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management , said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as %% part %% of the package . If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . '' Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .

A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed %% part %% of an interstate highway this summer . In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses .
part.n | 2 | The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs . And California 's 45-member delegation in the House is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is to consider Monday . For the most %% part %% , major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale . One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in , Seagate Technology , said it expects to be back at full strength Monday . The day before the quake , Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills .
part.n | 1 | Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between $ 130 million and $ 134 million . The move , subject to a definitive agreement , is %% part %% of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business . Just last month , a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for $ 168 million , a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year . First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about $ 550 million in loans outstanding .
part.n | 1 | Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances . Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools . You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years -- a %% part %% of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some $ 38 million .

part.n | 2 | But the brand had trouble from the start . The first Merkur , the XR4Ti , went on sale in early 1985 . The sporty coupe foundered in %% part %% because American buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual double-wing rear spoiler . In May 1987 , Ford began importing the Scorpio sedan from West Germany to sell next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms . Ford officials said they expected the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year , and in 1988 they reached that goal , as sales hit 15,261 cars .
part.n | 1 | In 1900 , for instance , less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits . That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since . Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small %% part %% of household assets until the last decade , when they skyrocketed . And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms . That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .
part.n | 1 | Under terms of the loan agreement , Amdura said it will omit the next quarterly dividends on its Series A , B , C and D preferred shares , which are due Nov. 15 . Since the preferred stock is cumulative , Amdura said it will pay all omitted dividends , which range from $ 1.19 to $ 4.88 a share , when debt-reduction requirements have been met . Amdura 's bridge loan , %% part %% of the financing for Amdura 's acquisition of CoastAmerica in December 1988 , was to come due next Friday . The company 's new management , which took control of Amdura 's board after a consent solicitation last month , wanted to extend the loan while it tries to sell two units . Proceeds from those sales will be used to reduce debt .

'' Because they want a truck that is `` Texas tough , '' the commercial concludes , `` Texans drive Chevy . '' J.C. Penney Co. , which relocated from New York to suburban Dallas two years ago , gently wraps itself in Texas pride through a full-page magazine ad : `` Taking the long-range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is %% part %% of the Lone Star lifestyle , '' the ad reads . `` It 's part of our style , too .

Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as `` %% part %% of a fundamental investment in the airline group . '' In 1989 , Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air , AMR and UAL . Overall , his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 % , he adds .
part.n | 1 | A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland . Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most %% parts %% of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
part.n | 1 | In addition , a planned two-part offering of $ 58 million in unsecured notes was n't offered . The first part , consisting of $ 2.5 million of 11 1\/4 % secured equipment certificates due June 15 , 1990 , was priced at 98.481 with a yield to maturity of 13.75 % .

part.n | 1 | Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area . About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks . Some adjusters , already in other %% parts %% of California , drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers . Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims . State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
part.n | 1 | Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans . Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey is n't really %% part %% of Europe . Why , they wonder , should it belong to the EC ? Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people : Turkey , we are told , is not a Christian nation ; its people simply wo n't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition .
part.n | 2 | Louise McNamee , Della Femina 's president , will continue running the U.S. agency day-to-day . They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum , which some industry executives pegged at about $ 10 million . WCRS Group , for its %% part %% , will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming `` a holding company for a series of media-related businesses , '' said Peter Scott , the firm 's chief executive . In addition to Carat , WCRS will hold onto its public relations , TV programming and other businesses . WCRS says its debt will be cut to # 24 million from # 66 million as a result of the transaction .
part.n | 1 | However , dozens of bakers , restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells . But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day , breaking them by hand can get , well , out of hand . The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple : put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible %% part %% through the baskets . One Egg King -- which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 -- can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour . Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones , a big egg user can recover the Egg King 's $ 3,390 cost in a few months , says Mr. Maynard .
part.n | 1 | During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return . The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal . Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as %% part %% of its anti-takeover restructuring . But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment . Last summer , Sears appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd .
part.n | 1 | Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Watson have been charged with criminal wrongdoing . By concealing the non-enforcement agreement , certain transactions with Messrs. Taylor and Watson were entered on FirstSouth 's books as loans , allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Little Rock , Ark . The conspiracy was %% part %% of an effort by Mr. Reed to hide FirstSouth 's shaky financial condition from federal regulators , according to federal prosecutors and regulators . The $ 1.68 billion thrift was declared insolvent and closed in December 1986 . FirstSouth 's former chairman and chief executive officer , Howard Weichern , is also charged with conspiring to conceal the agreements with Messrs. Watson and Taylor .

part.n | 1 | When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman . But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors . The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was %% part %% of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals . The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court . `` I think it 's fairly clear { Mr. Keating } knew , '' that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said .

The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander 's representation of Derr Construction Co. , one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks , the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center . Last month , Mr. Friend says , Mr. Alexander 's associate agreed that Derr would pay $ 50,000 as %% part %% of an overall settlement .

part.n | 1 | Bay Financial Corp. , hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments , reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings . Bay said a `` substantial %% part %% '' of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made . The company said its real estate portfolio is `` highly leveraged , '' while about two-thirds of its investments are n't income-producing . Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments .
part.n | 1 | A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers %% part %% of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial `` take-or-pay '' contracts . The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use . FERC 's regulation had given pipelines until March 31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short .

Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales .
part.n | 1 | The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` Metamorphosis , '' another multiple work . %% Parts %% 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name . When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film . Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium .
people.n | 1 | For example , paralyzed car-crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that , if preserved by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery .

people.n | 1 | Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio . The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business . But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and %% people %% familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week . Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions . But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .
people.n | 1 | The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name `` Judge O'Kicki . '' Yet , despite the judge 's imperial bearing , no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing , says John Bognato , president of Cambria County 's 150-member bar association . `` The arrogance of a judge , his demeanor , the way he handles %% people %% are not a basis for filing a complaint , '' says Mr. Bognato . `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County .
people.n | 1 | The figure excludes a record number employed by extraordinary government work programs , the Labor Directorate announced Tuesday . Including those in the state programs , there were 143,800 Norwegians , or about 6.5 % of the work force , without permanent employment in October , up from September 's 136,800 . The number of %% people %% registered as jobless at the end of October declined by 900 from September to 78,600 . Those employed in state-funded special programs increased by 7,400 to 65,200 in the same period , the Directorate said . In October 1988 , there were 40,800 fewer employed by government programs .
people.n | 2 | Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism . The Orwellian `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government , which would have licensing and censorship powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas . UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` %% peoples %% ' rights . '' Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational corporations . '' The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them .
people.n | 1 | Indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry . Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares . `` The primary overriding thing is that %% people %% are frightened , '' says Martin Sass , a New York money manager . `` The aftershocks of Oct. 13 ( when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points ) are still reverberating . '' Certainly , the Oct. 13 sell-off did n't settle any stomachs .
people.n | 1 | The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that . Big Board officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange 's own floor traders since the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's 190-point tumble on Oct. 13 . Mr. Phelan has n't been making public remarks in recent days , and many %% people %% have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue . What the Big Board is considering is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program trading when the market moves significantly . Early last year , after a 140-point , one-day drop in the Dow , the Big Board instituted the collar , which banned program trading through the Big Board 's computers whenever the Dow moved 50 points up or down in a day .
people.n | 1 | Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait . A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight %% people %% and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said . The blast , which wrecked the opposition labor group 's offices , was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador 's 10-year-old civil war . Hungary 's Parliament voted to hold a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president .
people.n | 1 | Philip Morris hopes that by taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves , in addition to publications , it will reach the broadest possible audience . Until now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines . `` Most %% people %% -- whether in Toledo , Tucson or Topeka -- have n't got a clue who we are , '' says Guy L. Smith , Philip Morris 's vice president of corporate affairs . `` If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights , it follows they 'll think well of our products . '' Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers .
people.n | 1 | Pinkerton 's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business , with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired , he adds . And regional offices were `` egregiously overstaffed , '' he claims . One office had 19 %% people %% doing the work of three , `` and half of the employees had company automobiles . '' American Brands declined to comment on Mr. Wathen 's accusations . The acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company , Pinkerton 's , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , California Plant Protection , with $ 250 million in sales , creating the industry 's biggest firm , which took on the Pinkerton 's name .
people.n | 1 | Britain 's Thatcher summoned senior advisers for strategy talks as opinion polls showed the prime minister 's popularity had hit a record low following the resignation last Thursday of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawson . One poll , conducted for the British Broadcasting Corp. , found that 52 % of voters believed that she should quit . Lawmakers in Hungary approved legislation granting amnesty to many %% people %% convicted of crimes punishable by less than three years in prison . They also established an office to control government and party finances . The laws take effect next month .
people.n | 1 | They have about seven candidates . Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . There is evidence that if %% people %% inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects . He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
people.n | 1 | `` It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far , be too pushy , '' agrees Gary Stibel , a principal with New England Consulting Group , Westport , Conn . `` The ultimate form of charity is when you do n't tell anyone . '' Still , he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have been truly beneficial to the %% people %% who need the help . We do n't consider that ambulance chasing . '' The companies running the disaster ads certainly do n't see themselves as ambulance chasers , either .
people.n | 1 | Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. . And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice . `` We have too many %% people %% in our home offices , '' says Yoshio Hatakeyama , the president of the Japan Management Association . `` Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low . '' With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners .
people.n | 1 | `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member . `` It 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make DEA , FBI and Customs work together '' on drug enforcement . Republicans acknowledge that few %% people %% would be executed under the Thurmond bill , but they contend that is n't the point . `` Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes , '' says Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R. , Utah ) . Executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also `` proper retribution '' for heinous crimes , Mr. Hatch argues .
people.n | 1 | If there 's something ' weird and it do n't look good . Who ya gon na call ? For starters , some %% people %% call Ed and Lorraine Warren . When it comes to busting ghosts , the Monroe , Conn. , couple are perfect demons . They claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country .
people.n | 1 | `` The movies , the books , the tabloids -- even Nancy Reagan is boosting this stuff , '' says Paul Kurtz , a philosophy professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo , who heads the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal . The committee , formed in 1967 , now has 60 chapters around the world . The spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether %% people %% do or do n't believe in them . They do n't even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating Halloween . For the spooks it 's just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual , ghostbusters say ; the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports .
people.n | 1 | It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout . The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found . Fewer %% people %% said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics . Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise . That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
people.n | 1 | `` I spent so much money that if I look at it , and I 'm not on it , I feel guilty . '' The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do . A surprising 78 % of %% people %% said they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 . This conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests couch potatoes are out of season . Of course , that is n't really the case .
people.n | 1 | `` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year , '' says Krys Spain , research specialist for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . `` It 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully . %% People %% are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything . '' While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of Americans who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is only 10 % to 20 % . So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60 % of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes .
people.n | 1 | A spokeswoman adds , however , that the group is considering offering `` a behavior-modification course , similar to a smoking-cessation program , to teach people ways to stay with it . '' There are die-hard bodies , of course . The proprietor of Sante West , an aerobics studio in San Francisco 's Marina district , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` %% People %% were going nuts the minute we opened , '' three days after the quake . `` The emotional aspect is so draining , they needed a good workout . '' Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered American institution .
people.n | 1 | Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare . State governments place very low ceilings on how much property %% people %% may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills . Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance . But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
people.n | 1 | Dissidents in Czechoslovakia said the nation 's pro-democracy movement was growing despite the government 's move to crush a protest Saturday in Prague 's Wenceslas Square . More than 10,000 demonstrators had called for free elections and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes . Police detained more than 350 %% people %% . Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people . Congress sent to Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % .
people.n | 2 | Wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among `` la-la activists . '' Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American %% people %% these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth .
people.n | 1 | He adds , `` That 's the forecasting business . '' However risky the business , it 's brisk these days . Pestered by bosses , brokers , clients and media %% people %% and pushed by their own egos , Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator . But the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast . This is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities .
people.n | 1 | The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management . `` The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways , '' Mr. Westendorf concludes . `` First , we have better quality assurance than ever , because the %% people %% building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work . Second , we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product . '' At Grumman 's Aircraft Systems Division , a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract .
people.n | 1 | Behind them was a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that said `` ANC Lives , ANC Leads . '' Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party , which has long been an ANC ally . In the stands , %% people %% waved ANC flags , wore ANC T-shirts , sang ANC songs and chanted ANC slogans . `` Today , '' said Mr. Sisulu , `` the ANC has captured the center stage of political life in South Africa . '' As a police helicopter circled overhead , Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations : Release all political prisoners unconditionally ; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations ; remove all troops from the black townships ; end the state of emergency , and cease all political trials and political executions .
people.n | 1 | One thing 's for sure : There have been a ton of them , and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest . Gerald Ford , a fairly down-to-earth fellow , once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that `` there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon . I think we owe it to the American %% people %% to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject . '' Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise : `` If I become president , I 'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public , and the scientists . I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one ... . ''
people.n | 1 | But tonight 's offering , `` Settle the Score '' ( 9-11 p.m. EST , on NBC ) , does n't even try . This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks . But it 's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry : `` Fear of violence and animosity ... because of race or religion , fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town %% people %% ... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers . '' The writer and executive producer of `` Settle the Score , '' Steve Sohmer , is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary , aired this summer , in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation . At one point in the documentary , Mr. Sohmer , who is Jewish , says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale .
people.n | 1 | The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely . This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects . The question , as many %% people %% see it , is how long such uncertainty will last . Maureen Fraser , an economist with W.I. Carr , a subsidiary of France 's Banque Indosuez , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 . It may experience an upswing or two in between .
people.n | 1 | `` Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide . `` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % . Small-business %% people %% end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness . '' In addition , the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce , hemorrhoids and overweight . The Health Insurance Association of America , an insurers ' trade group , acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market .
people.n | 1 | By ignoring costs , U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions . That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers . These %% people %% have different agendas . And as a result -- as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney 's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense `` strategy . '' How can we turn this situation around ?
people.n | 1 | Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group , which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S. , by as much as 15 % as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business . Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8 % , or 400 %% people %% . The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul , during which it also lost as many as 400 employees , a company spokesman said in response to questions . Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc. , the group involved , currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000 .
people.n | 1 | Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral . Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves . The %% people %% of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students . Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians . Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance .
people.n | 1 | `` The balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the UAL deal -- we got a little pop . '' The pop sobered up investors who had been getting a little too ebullient , says Mr. Jarrett . `` It provided an excuse for %% people %% to get back to reality and to look at the economic data , especially the third-quarter economic numbers , and to realize that we ca n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market . '' But he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued , even with the economy obviously slowing . `` Just because we 've got some realism back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here , '' he says .
people.n | 1 | `` We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance , '' Mr. Thompson says . `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance %% people %% to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York exchanges have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges .
people.n | 1 | They should never be on . Never . '' Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among %% people %% who knew and loved the man . That includes his companion of 15 years , Johanna Lawrenson , as well as his former wife , Anita . Both women say they also find it distasteful that CBS News is apparently concentrating on Mr. Hoffman 's problems as a manic-depressive .
people.n | 1 | In Mr. Luzon 's first year , the bank eliminated 800 jobs . Now it says it 'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years . The bank employs 8,000 %% people %% in Spain and 2,000 abroad . To strengthen its capital base , Banco Exterior this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors . The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches .
people.n | 1 | There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations . More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January . The firm 's brokerage force has been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 %% people %% . Mr. Carpenter says that when he assumes full control , Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE . One of GE 's goals when it bought 80 % of Kidder in 1986 was to take advantage of `` syngeries '' between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp. , GE 's corporate-finance unit , which has $ 42 billion in assets .
people.n | 1 | So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about . I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem . The efforts to get to the %% people %% who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work . The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs .
people.n | 1 | Hassan Kamel Ali is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed : `` I live in this world , assuming that there is no morality , God or police . '' For the killer and thief , Said Mahran , fame flows from the barrel of a gun . `` One man said you act as a stimulant , '' a prostitute tells him , `` a diversion to relieve %% people %% 's boredom . '' Mr. Mahfouz 's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God , not crime , for their salvation . But it is his portrait of Cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts , of streets filled with `` dust , vegetable litter , and animal dung '' -- that made his reputation , and won him the Nobel Prize in 1988 .
people.n | 1 | Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . The number of %% people %% receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % . Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
people.n | 1 | If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar 's assets , he could be left without top-flight legal representation , because his attorneys are likely to quit , according to individuals familiar with the case . A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs . `` The people who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the %% people %% who suffer in the long run are all of the people , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights , '' says Gerald Lefcourt , a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures . Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark , where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges . Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , or RICO , the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial .
people.n | 1 | The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s , before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry 's deregulation in 1986 . `` People come to us saying they 'd like to be back where they were a few years ago , in a more collegial atmosphere , with less tension , '' says Stephen Waterhouse , managing director of Hanover Partners Ltd. , a financial district head-hunting firm . But after trading losses in the mid-October market jolts here , many %% people %% will be lucky to have jobs at all , executives predict . The industry , which currently employs about 25,000 people in London , has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years . `` I can see cuts of at least 20 % more , '' says the head of the London office of a major U.S. firm .
people.n | 1 | After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital . But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn . %% People %% familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine . Then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from Finland 's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen . Analysts say Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine 's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August .
people.n | 1 | But in 1989 most senators have other ideas . Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama . Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get %% people %% hurt , a charming notion for a great power . Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban . So the administration dropped it .
people.n | 1 | That 's even less than the 4.35 % total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index . Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19 , Lipper says ; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % . %% People %% who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say . Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions . Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers .
people.n | 1 | Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins 's support among Jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points . In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty . `` A lot of %% people %% think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says . `` I am aware we have real budgetary problems . '' The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
people.n | 2 | Even now , the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat . I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan . Colombia alone -- its government , its %% people %% , its newspapers -- does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully . All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs . The U.S. , as the major drug consumer , should lead this joint effort .
people.n | 1 | -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect . The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President Roh . But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary %% people %% to buy a home . Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .
people.n | 1 | A brief `` executive summary '' was issued last April , and attracted some , but not much , attention . More-detailed reports followed , and attracted even less notice . I suspect I may be one of the few %% people %% to have read them all . The sixth and last report now is out , and it puts the effort in perspective . Titled `` Comments From Students , '' it focuses on the real shame of college sports : what happens to young athletes once they enter academe .
people.n | 1 | He 's rich , famous and intelligent , and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do . Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless , speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind . Personally , I 'm glad there are %% people %% like him around to slow down the profit takers , and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future , not caring about the long-range implications . Ron Dyer
people.n | 1 | Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures . And , defenders say , few %% people %% complain about futures when stock prices are rising . Louis Margolis , managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures . Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs .
people.n | 1 | To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that %% people %% ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year .
people.n | 1 | UNC also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor . At as little as one-third of the government 's cost , the company is running a program to train Army helicopter pilots . It is also taking over the maintenance of certain Navy aircraft with 40 % fewer %% people %% than the military used . In another approach , tiny Iverson Technology is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products . Donald Iverson , chairman , says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets .
people.n | 1 | ( There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . ) What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines . It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its %% people %% and in its island geography . As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children . As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school .
people.n | 1 | `` Are you stupid ? '' he snaps . `` You should know what questions to ask to get people to answer . '' Not many %% people %% know the details of Mr. Morishita 's business , but it 's a source of rumors about shady dealings . When a small company goes belly-up , for instance , the gossipy weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with Aichi . Mr. Morishita scoffs at those stories , as well as the ones connecting him to the Japanese mob .
people.n | 1 | Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high . Last year , the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area 's casinos , nearly 10 % more than in 1987 . The %% people %% with a stake in Nevada 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade . `` If you build a better mousetrap , it will catch more mice , '' says Fred Benninger , chairman of MGM Grand . Ellen Cokely , a tourist from Alton , Ill. , seems inclined to agree .
people.n | 1 | The Epilepsy Institute 's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily . This perhaps was perceived as a `` bold '' stance , and thus suspicious . But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for %% people %% 's health care or for the cost . For whom is the saving ? Surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control .
people.n | 1 | Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed . They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly . Ms. Bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or %% people %% . Kelly\/Varnell had put South Gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall . This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist 's own digs : `` My loft was 50 by 100 feet , so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room . ''
people.n | 1 | Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year : They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market , and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money . These %% people %% invested in `` leveraged '' junk bond mutual funds , the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk . It 's a good strategy in a rising market , where a 25 % leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125 % of their money working for them . The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio .
people.n | 1 | This is not the case . Some diaries simply are n't worth snooping in . Yet there will be %% people %% who will sob at `` Immediate Family , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption . These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told . Written by Barbara Benedek , co-author of `` The Big Chill , '' `` Immediate Family '' takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children .
people.n | 1 | While the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student , it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath . Bias 's coach , Lefty Driesell , ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive ( the order was n't carried out ) , and the school 's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players . Those , of course , were the responses of %% people %% with something to hide . One wonders how other college athletic officials would behave under the same circumstances . Tomorrow 's `` On Sports '' column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess .
people.n | 1 | Indeed , it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information . '' Now , scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation . And of course they agree that %% people %% can impose restrictions on the use of their papers , whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries . But in the `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act . And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials , copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points .
people.n | 1 | But the amounts they exchange may be limited ; most Soviet hotels , for example , demand payment in hard currency from Western visitors . Unless other rules are changed , the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help : Soviets who travel abroad . Over the past three years , thousands of %% people %% here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad . But under current rules , they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip . At the new rate , that would give them about $ 30 to travel on .
people.n | 2 | `` The president does n't want to have legislative sanctions , '' says a U.S. official . `` But he may not have a choice . '' Given China 's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own %% people %% , Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions . Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations . Sentences have been stiff .
people.n | 1 | Not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings . But many have . `` These people bounce back more resiliently than regular %% people %% , '' says Washington writer Suzanne Garment , who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal . Given their own penchant for book writing , it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art . For there is an emerging protocol -- indeed , an etiquette -- to it .
people.n | 1 | HEALTH CLUBS gear up for a graying clientele . Although their ads picture curvy young %% people %% in skimpy outfits , club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set . `` It 's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged , '' says Michael Pacholik , sales manager of the LA Fitness club , Diamond Bar , Calif . About 10 % to 15 % of members at Atlanta 's Holiday Espre Center are elderly , says Gerald Williams , fitness consultant .
people.n | 1 | Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` European companies are looking to buy American ones , '' said Henry King , the managing partner at that firm . `` But the question is whether things %% people %% are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions .

people.n | 1 | A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone . With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings , `` it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching , '' says Mr. Appel . `` But we were getting too many complaints that %% people %% were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors .

people.n | 1 | And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced . A DLJ banker , putting a best possible face on it , asserts that `` very few people said they did n't like the credit quality . %% People %% said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade . '' But trading risk stems from credit risk . And by adding equity , DLJ would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern .
people.n | 1 | To some mothers , the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been . `` My first reaction is I do n't understand why it 's taken so long . Why has it taken %% people %% so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem ? '' asked Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion . Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill . `` While I 'm pleased the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' said Rep. Ted Weiss .
people.n | 1 | Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful IG Metall metals worker union in West Berlin raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring , they said . For the 1990 wage negotiations , the IG Metall is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases , which could sharply increase the costs for German industry . `` All the positive figures on the economy are out already , and %% people %% are focusing more on the dangers for next year , mostly the wage talks and the { parliamentary } elections , '' the U.S. trader said . The market also shrugged off positive factors , such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in September , traders said . They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer , as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile .
people.n | 1 | `` It 's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought , '' he said .

people.n | 1 | The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association , a Lexington , Ky.-based trade group , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential investors '' at race tracks around the country . The group , which has held half a dozen seminars so far , also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers . `` %% People %% in this business have been insulated , '' says Josh Pons , a horse breeder from Bel Air , Md . `` But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses . '' At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker .
people.n | 1 | ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS : Next to medical insurance , `` costs of compliance '' are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc. , a Providence , R.I. , chemical company . Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the %% people %% to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 . Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president .

people.n | 1 | No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority , but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts . Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences . `` In the past , %% people %% who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said . `` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
people.n | 1 | Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier , but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood . Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that , inexplicably , held against the waves . `` The Caterpillar %% people %% are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that , '' shrugs Mr. George . `` They figure it 's not a very good advert . '' Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators .
people.n | 1 | But less than two years later , the LDP started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights . The symptoms all point to one thing : Japan does not have a modern government . Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million %% people %% in the back seat . In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice . It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world .
people.n | 2 | This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries . All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the %% people %% , and particularly not consumers . They serve the industries and the special-interest groups . The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing .
people.n | 2 | The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese %% people %% , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .
people.n | 1 | `` When Sears has a sale at a special price , '' the woman in the ad declares , `` it 's something you do n't want to miss . '' Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates , a market research firm in Chicago , suggest that Sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise . The number of %% people %% who said they were more likely to shop at Sears fell in September to 37 % from 66 % in March , when Sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy . Moreover , the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in Sears declined to 16 % in September from 33 % in March . Just 5 % of the respondents mentioned brands in September , up slightly from 2 % in March .
people.n | 1 | At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several %% people %% familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state .
people.n | 1 | It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do . It 's that we do n't want to . And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young %% people %% in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests . These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them . Here is an example .
people.n | 1 | Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured . %% People %% who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
people.n | 1 | `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . `` The affluent %% people %% and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .
people.n | 1 | Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , Litigation Sciences advises . So would someone recently divorced or widowed . ( Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such %% people %% from the jury . ) For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve . Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women .
people.n | 1 | A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant ( not at Litigation Sciences ) $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine . Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick . `` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how %% people %% of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co . He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . '' But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken .
people.n | 1 | `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 %% people %% in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables .
people.n | 2 | A De Beers spokesman said yesterday the company had offered to increase the minimum wage by 18 % , while the union was demanding 26.6 % . Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % . China 's %% People %% 's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud . Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People 's Bank of China in Shenzhen , 15 major cases have been found , the paper said ; the biggest was the theft of $ 235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988 . The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models .
people.n | 1 | After the legislature confirmed him as the Communist Party leader , Krenz said demonstrations to demand democratic freedoms could cause a `` worsening of the situation , or confrontation . '' He also reaffirmed East Germany 's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy . But as many as 12,000 %% people %% marched in East Berlin after the speech to protest his election . During the balloting , 26 members of the 500-seat Parliament voted against Krenz , a move considered unprecedented in the country 's 40-year history . Officials in East Berlin , responding to complaints from opposition groups , admitted police used excessive force in dispersing protesters this month .
people.n | 1 | Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday . `` It 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy , given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks , '' said Robert T. McGee , a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd . `` %% People %% are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but they 're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market . '' The new two-year notes were priced with an average yield of 7.74 % . That was higher than the 7.71 % to 7.73 % average yield that traders had expected .
people.n | 1 | As for junk-holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR . The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar , according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York , which trades distressed securities . %% People %% who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders say that 's not enough .

people.n | 1 | It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important %% people %% came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says .
people.n | 1 | Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards , Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $ 3 billion annually . The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures , behind West Germany , Finland and Italy . According to several %% people %% present at the meeting , Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S. , possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush . Judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products .

people.n | 1 | In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one . The title of chief executive officer is n't used . While %% people %% within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many . It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president . Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .

And last week , %% people %% close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .

Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results . `` %% People %% are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley . Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell . However , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance .
people.n | 1 | On lampposts along Fillmore Street , a major Marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake . The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals . The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some %% people %% have sought temporary homes for birds and fish . For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat . `` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA .
people.n | 1 | The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas . The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill . Beheading small children , stabbing elderly %% people %% to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years . Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops . In the port of Berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever .
people.n | 2 | In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government . Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort . There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban %% people %% . Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
people.n | 2 | Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people . They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances . It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the %% people %% ( as we well know ) , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy . Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime , such as facilitating defections . I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory .
people.n | 2 | Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill . The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American %% people %% , states and local governments . Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s . In fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief .
people.n | 1 | Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % . Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of %% people %% receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
people.n | 1 | As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for %% people %% aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
people.n | 1 | Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance . But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help . The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike %% people %% at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings . The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing . The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies .
people.n | 1 | What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ? Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ? Because in the end , these %% people %% always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? '' There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them . `` These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms .
people.n | 1 | `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . '' Adds Spencer Barasch , branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth , Texas : `` Why do %% people %% play the lottery when the odds are great against them ? People are shooting for a dream . '' Clearly , though , scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
people.n | 1 | `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . `` %% People %% honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy .
people.n | 1 | Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point , timing is crucial . People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives . `` Sometimes when %% people %% are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm . `` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . '' They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
people.n | 1 | Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and %% people %% whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
people.n | 1 | Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . In the early stage of checking %% people %% with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident . `` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. Hicks declares . Mr. Schmedel is editor of The Wall Street Journal 's Tax Report column .
people.n | 1 | The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . `` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . `` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich %% people %% . '' No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
people.n | 1 | Surveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all . For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says Barbara Roper , who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America , a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington . She concedes that such a position is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified %% people %% plying the trade , but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it . She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off . '' The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning .
people.n | 1 | Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . '' He declines to go into specifics . Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which %% people %% generally are more prone to sue . `` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he says . Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore .
people.n | 1 | `` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others . This is clearly not good news to all you %% people %% who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
people.n | 1 | `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture %% people %% about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
people.n | 1 | East Germany 's leadership vowed swift action to ease travel to the West . Despite the pledge by the Communist rulers , tens of thousands of people across the country staged marches over the weekend to demand democratic freedoms . In Leipzig , more than 500 %% people %% met with local party officials to discuss internal changes . The Senate convicted federal Judge Alcee Hastings of Miami of eight impeachment articles , removing him from the bench . The chamber voted 69-26 Friday to convict the judge of perjury and bribery conspiracy .
people.n | 1 | But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . '' However , several %% people %% said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
people.n | 1 | Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold . Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year . But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for %% people %% to bring me ideas . '' Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .

'' He was turning himself in . `` Frankly , as I was walking back to get in my car , I heard many , many %% people %% ... opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in , '' he said . `` As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself . '' We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
people.n | 1 | Some businesses -- like Disneyland -- claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis , they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days . `` Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan , '' says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz , manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles . `` If you do n't save your critical %% people %% , you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions . '' Although ARCO 's head office , more than 300 miles from the epicenter , was n't affected by this week 's tremors , Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of `` Earthquake Tips '' to 1,200 ARCO employees . `` You need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention , '' she says .
people.n | 1 | The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God . '' For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not . We still have %% people %% wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight . '' But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering . In San Francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
people.n | 1 | And it works best in high-powered personal computers . But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic . Jeffrey Tarter , editor of SoftLetter , a Watertown , Mass. , industry newsletter , says : `` I 've seen a lot of %% people %% fooling around on the fringes of filtering information . This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using . '' NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases .
people.n | 1 | Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many %% people %% and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .
people.n | 1 | The poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics . It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . Of 1,500 %% people %% sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . The response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though .
people.n | 1 | `` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent . `` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . '' Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many %% people %% in Hollywood the wrong way . Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film . Says Mr. Simpson : `` The script was unreadable .

These %% people %% used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone . Either way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor . Of the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
people.n | 1 | Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $ 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ 5 to cancer education . `` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages . I think some %% people %% may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says . Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls . Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
people.n | 1 | Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years . Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says . Mr. Katz adds that %% people %% who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy . Frequent trading runs up high commission costs . And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
people.n | 1 | I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . '' I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them . Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into %% people %% 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat . `` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction . A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway .

During Winter Carnival week , for example , visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride . `` %% People %% these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M.

'' Polls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter . Unless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month .

'' Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman . `` Some %% people %% call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors . Actually , 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land . She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state-owned .
people.n | 1 | Your Sept. 27 page-one article `` Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo , Especially Gentility '' leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience . The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery . Not mentioned were the 50,000 %% people %% rendered homeless , and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period ; the $ 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands ; the near - and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry , tourism , not to mention the human suffering . In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities , your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city . The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .

people.n | 1 | At Jasper Jeep-Eagle , one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country , inventories have continued to swell . Steve Lowe , general manager of Jasper , Ga. , dealership , said new rebates of $ 500 to $ 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks . `` If %% people %% are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said . Separately , Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models . Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected .
people.n | 1 | Argentina and Britain agreed to resume diplomatic and economic relations , seven years after the two nations battled over the Falkland Islands . The announcement , in which they said hostilities had ceased , followed a two-day meeting in Madrid . Rebel artillerists bombarded the capital of Afghanistan , killing at least 12 %% people %% , as the Soviet Union was reported to be airlifting arms and food to Kabul 's forces . Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war .
people.n | 1 | San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for helping %% people %% find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday 's catastrophic earthquake . `` The press has been doing an excellent job .

Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt , say %% people %% close to him , is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls . While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway , are pretty strong . USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. Steinhardt says .
people.n | 2 | West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful . `` He does n't signify what people want , so the unrest will go on , '' Mr. Oldenburg predicts . At the same time , the expectations of the East German %% people %% are great and will continue to grow . Says one West German official : `` What 's necessary now is the process of democratization . Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously . ''
people.n | 1 | A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed , he adds . Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion . The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of %% people %% seeking to make a call at the same time . The volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes . Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal .
people.n | 1 | In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs . On the periphery , rescue workers seem , from the air , to move in slow motion . They peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble , searching for more of the 250 %% people %% thought to have died here . About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake . The heart of the earthquake , 6.9 on the Richter scale , was 50 miles to the south , near Santa Cruz , but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway , a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco .
people.n | 1 | Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me , and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale . '' Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer . %% People %% often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising conveys , whether that 's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher 's Uninhibited perfume . Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries . Only 23 % of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand , and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand .

people.n | 5 | The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community . Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another %% people %% ? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans .
people.n | 5 | Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria . The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently . Surely , the past suffering of any %% people %% at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten . But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories . Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists .

people.n | 1 | Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods . Intel Corp. , Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take the day off . `` These systems are more rugged than many %% people %% would believe , '' said Thomas Kurlak , who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research . `` It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit .

people.n | 1 | But the median income of American families fell 0.2 % , the first time it has failed to rise since 1982 . Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure , including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who are n't living in families . As a result of last year 's decline , the government 's estimate for the number of %% people %% living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000 . The poverty threshold , defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department , last year was $ 12,092 for a family of four . The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line , but it does n't consider other government benefits , such as Medicare .
people.n | 4 | United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area . A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors . The United spokesman said none of its %% people %% were injured at the airport ; in fact , as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night , two babies were born . Yesterday , the United ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends . The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday , the Federal Aviation Administration said .

The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots , 500 blankets , and 300 pints of Type-O blood . It is also pulling 20 %% people %% out of Puerto Rico , who were helping Huricane Hugo victims , and sending them to San Francisco instead .
people.n | 1 | Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` %% People %% are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness . Since March , exports have been virtually flat .
people.n | 1 | Mr. Laband gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong . They set up absurd situations , detached from reality , and then try to reason from them . I 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting %% people %% loot , since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and `` every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor . '' Price controls were `` so fervently embraced by Charleston '' because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting . Suzanne Foster
people.n | 2 | Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker : Both spent years overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend , the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens . More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo . Faced with another Mr. Honecker , so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German %% peoples %% will get their reunification , de facto , on West German ground . But if East Germany 's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental . Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall .
people.n | 1 | The protesters who greeted Mikhail Gorbachev at East Berlin 's airport earlier this month were n't shouting `` Go U.S.A '' -- they were chanting `` Gorby , Help Us . '' Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process . Helmut Kohl 's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 %% people %% of German descent automatic citizens this year alone . But within the government and in the think tanks outside it , many West Germans maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification . Politically , this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring France .

In Oakland , hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway . At least 270 %% people %% were reported killed and 1,400 injured in the rush-hour tremor that caused billions of dollars of damage along 100 miles of the San Andreas fault .

people.n | 5 | Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful . For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent , based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf . No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan %% people %% to give up their struggle . A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain . Creation of a new , realistic U.S. policy is long overdue .
people.n | 1 | The cross-border loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter , while Venezuela brought itself `` substantially current . '' Overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . `` %% People %% were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a Citicorp spokesman said . But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . Ronald I.

people.n | 1 | In filing an original ( not amended ) return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately . THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims . Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday , but the IRS says %% people %% in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` Hugo '' and postmarked by Jan. 16 . Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability . IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims .
people.n | 1 | The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of %% people %% between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % .
people.n | 1 | When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans . `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence %% people %% could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers .
people.n | 1 | There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say . Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living . %% People %% also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . `` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. Blankenship , a Del Mar , Calif. financial planner . But once the basics are covered , `` then I would start to invest , even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 , '' says Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc .

The chair is a way to package massage . '' Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer 's chairs , which cost $ 425 and have since been copied by others , is a bit like straddling a recliner .
people.n | 1 | The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets . An ebullient Kenneth Iverson , Nucor 's chairman , says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill . `` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and %% people %% from India visiting us , '' Mr. Iverson beams . `` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . '' Especially his neighbors , the major U.S. steelmakers .
people.n | 1 | Other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests . And some investors at Fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day . `` Two years ago , there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with %% people %% getting through on the phone , '' said Kathryn McGrath , head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission . This time , `` We do n't have that at all . '' Of course , the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again .

Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September . These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new %% plant %% and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable goods . Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later . The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in
plant.n | 2 | Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . The researchers said they have isolated a %% plant %% gene that prevents the production of pollen . The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself . Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed .
plant.n | 2 | The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself . Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed . The new generation of %% plants %% will possess the flourishing , high-production trait known as `` hybrid vigor , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn . `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains .
plant.n | 2 | That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile %% plants %% . The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants . The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies .
plant.n | 2 | A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other . The anthers in these %% plants %% are difficult to clip off . In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds . At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility .
plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .
plant.n | 2 | They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene . Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed . The laws of heredity dictate that half of the %% plants %% springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible . The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants , leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed . Mr. Leemans said the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield 15 % to 30 % more output than the commercial strains used currently .
plant.n | 2 | In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co . One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen . But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging %% plants %% ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects . However , Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences , said the company 's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ . '' Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. , is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen .

The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its anti-Western ideology , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand . The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB %% plants %% and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds . Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor , has had little success at achieving reforms . Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else 's statism .

Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid %% plants %% for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait .

'' According to industry analysts , Chrysler plants most likely to close are the St. Louis No. 1 facility , which builds Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models ; the Toledo , Ohio , Jeep %% plant %% , which dates back to the early 1900s ; and two Canadian plants that build the Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler 's full-sized vans . Chrysler has had to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there . At Chrysler 's 1990 model preview last month , Chrysler Motors President Robert A. Lutz said the No. 3 auto maker , along with other U.S. manufacturers , might be forced to `` realign ... capacity '' if market demand does n't improve .

Lutz said the No. 3 auto maker , along with other U.S. manufacturers , might be forced to `` realign ... capacity '' if market demand does n't improve . But Mr. Iacocca 's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy . General Motors Corp. has signaled that as many as five of its U.S. and Canadian %% plants %% may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity . The overcapacity problem has intensified in recent years , with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the U.S. . With companies such as Honda Motor Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. running so-called transplant auto operations , Japanese auto production in the U.S. will reach one million vehicles this year .

plant.n | 1 | `` Westinghouse 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , '' says Russell L. Leavitt , of Salomon Brothers Inc . The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade . Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt %% plants %% from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others . Westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing . In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals .
plant.n | 1 | Under the agreement , Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment . Westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with Misubishi , giving it an edge in developing Asian markets . In addition , the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the %% plants %% ordered by Florida Power , and even utilize each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations . `` Even though we 'll still compete against Mitsubishi , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. Stern contends . The Westinghouse-Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust concerns .
plant.n | 1 | Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity . Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear %% plant %% in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .

Even stranger is the case of Usha Rectifier , a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $ 28 million that 's raising $ 270 million to build an iron %% plant %% . Once the money is raised , it is n't always certain how it is used . Larsen & Toubro , for example , says it 's raising $ 570 million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs .
plant.n | 1 | The oat-bran craze has cost the world 's largest cereal maker market share . The company 's president quit suddenly . And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $ 1 billion cereal %% plant %% . The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions . But the Memphis , Tenn. , facility was n't to begin turning out product until 1993 , so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well .
plant.n | 1 | The company has five other U.S. plants , including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100 , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year . General Mills , meanwhile , finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity . A large %% plant %% in Covington , Ga. , is to come on line next year . A Kellogg officer , who asked not to be named , said the Memphis project was `` pulled in for a reconsideration of costs , '' an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction . Initial cost estimates for the plant , which was to have been built in phases , ranged from $ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion .
plant.n | 1 | The complex is to be located in Batangas , about 70 miles south of Manila .

plant.n | 2 | South Gardens , as the Bartlett scheme is called , will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan . It could cost taxpayers $ 15 million to install and BPC residents $ 1 million a year to maintain . Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of %% plants %% and gardens , South Gardens , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design . Ms. Bartlett 's previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject . Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb .
plant.n | 2 | Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed . They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly . Ms. Bartlett 's little rooms left little room for %% plants %% or people . Kelly\/Varnell had put South Gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall . This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist 's own digs : `` My loft was 50 by 100 feet , so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room . ''
plant.n | 2 | Lynden B. Miller , the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park 's Conservatory Garden , recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street 's Bryant Park : `` Bryant Park , as designed in 1933 , failed as a public space , because it made people feel trapped . By removing the hedges and some walls , the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up . It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and %% plants %% . '' The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . '' They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places .

plant.n | 1 | McDonald 's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988 . But Goodyear said total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2 % . Total tire segment sales were up only about 1 % to $ 2.2 billion , and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire %% plants %% because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers . In the latest quarter , Goodyear 's tax rate was 51 % compared with 41 % a year earlier . As a result , total tax outlays were $ 73.5 million , compared with $ 44.1 million the year earlier .
plant.n | 1 | Birmingham Steel Corp. said that its Emeryville , Calif. , minimill sustained only minor damage from last week 's earthquake . Steelmaking resumed Oct. 18 , but the company expects production to be hampered in the next few months by traffic disruptions around the %% plant %% and outages for repair to gas and electric power systems .
plant.n | 1 | Because most businesses put market share above profitability , to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat . The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd. , Japan 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners . Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another %% plant %% , which will lift its production capacity 50 % . The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to 30 % from 27 % currently . Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , `` are all adding production lines , '' a Daikin spokesman says .
plant.n | 1 | `` It 's important to gain leadership , '' a Toshiba spokesman says . Meanwhile , Toshiba 's Japanese rivals , Hitachi , Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. , are n't sitting still .

The new chip plants `` wo n't be excessive investment , '' says Hajime Sasaki , an NEC vice president . `` We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . ''
plant.n | 1 | Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say . In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several %% plants %% and reducing labor costs . But the short-term outlook is so-so . It is n't surprising that Messrs. Roderick and Corry view steel so differently .
plant.n | 1 | `` The outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said David Wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee . He also said investment by businesses is falling off . Of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on %% plant %% equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more . But despite mounting recession fears , government data do n't yet show the economy grinding to a halt . Unemployment , for example , has continued to decline , and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports .
plant.n | 1 | Grain , milk and meat come next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast .

plant.n | 1 | The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms . `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese %% plant %% to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated .
plant.n | 1 | Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman said . The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses . The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly %% plant %% at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 . About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down . Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations .
plant.n | 1 | The Treasury Department said S&Ls reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites . The department 's Office of Thrift Supervision said that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are biased , but conceded that it does n't have data about applicants to determine why blacks are rejected more often . Emergency crews searched through the charred rubble of a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics %% plant %% near Pasadena , Texas , where a series of explosions Monday killed at least two people and injured 124 .

The plastics %% plant %% is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast . The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area . The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo .
plant.n | 1 | Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies . At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers . He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power %% plants %% in Vermont . At Yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland . Mr. McDonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York .
plant.n | 1 | The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants . So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old %% plants %% . The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology . The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles .
plant.n | 1 | USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new %% plant %% to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market . Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons . The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
plant.n | 1 | For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield %% plant %% for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
plant.n | 1 | `` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room . Indeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant . Of the four , only the bank and the %% plant %% drew bids -- one apiece . In October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos . Two years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .
plant.n | 1 | In the quarterly report , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer , said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue . Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 . Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing %% plant %% in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs . `` With the Edison plant coming on line next summer , the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future , '' said Peter Appert , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell . `` But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons . ''
plant.n | 1 | Most of the commodity traffic was off , the company said . Earnings from continuing operations of the Union Pacific Resources unit almost doubled , the company said . It added that higher revenue , strong crude oil prices and higher natural gas prices offset declines in production of oil , gas and %% plant %% liquids . In addition , the company cited cost-reduction moves and interest income . Earnings from Union Pacific Realty dropped 50 % to $ 3 million .
plant.n | 1 | Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines . Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration %% plants %% east of the Mississippi River . Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . `` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said .
plant.n | 1 | The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs . And California 's 45-member delegation in the House is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop-gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is to consider Monday . For the most part , major corporations ' headquarters and %% plants %% were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale . One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in , Seagate Technology , said it expects to be back at full strength Monday . The day before the quake , Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills .
plant.n | 1 | The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community . Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ( $ 157.8 million ) in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs . In addition , the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their %% plants %% . Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles . By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
plant.n | 1 | He added , though , that `` a lot of this is intentions ... . We 'll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops . The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the %% plant %% floor . While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools , Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing . Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena .
plant.n | 1 | Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 . About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 , and overtime has been eliminated at the %% plant %% for the fourth quarter , a Chrysler spokesman said . That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations . Sales of Cherokee , the best-selling Jeep , and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
plant.n | 1 | Steve Lowe , general manager of Jasper , Ga. , dealership , said new rebates of $ 500 to $ 1,000 on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks . `` If people are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said . Separately , Chrysler said it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly %% plant %% that builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models . Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected . General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October .

General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October . GM said the assembly %% plant %% , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
plant.n | 1 | The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook , N.H. , nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the %% plant %% receives a full-power license . Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon , opposing the license , said he will appeal the ruling in federal court . Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year .
plant.n | 1 | AT&T unveiled a sweetened early retirement plan for management that the company hopes will save it $ 450 million in the next year . Also , profit rose 19 % in the third quarter . Chrysler will idle a Toledo assembly %% plant %% temporarily due to slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles . Digital Equipment 's profit fell 32 % in the latest quarter , prompting forecasts of weaker results ahead . Analysts were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders at the computer maker .
plant.n | 1 | Springs Industries dropped 1 3\/8 to 36 . Analysts at several brokerage firms lowered their 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates on the company after its third-quarter results proved disappointing . Trinova third-quarter loss after a charge for a planned restructuring , which will include the closing or downsizing of about 25 % of its %% plants %% and a work force cut of about 1,500 over three years . The Amex Market Value Index snapped a five-session losing streak by rising 2.91 to 378.07 . Volume totaled 12,500,000 shares .
plant.n | 1 | It is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter . Typical , perhaps , was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. , the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont , about 35 miles south of Oakland . Ten of the %% plant %% 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized . Metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says . The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
plant.n | 1 | Control Data Corp. agreed to sell its idle supercomputer manufacturing %% plant %% here to Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. for $ 5.8 million . The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories . Control Data has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer unit this past April .
plant.n | 1 | In addition , some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday 's . Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor . Intel said that over the past decade , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its %% plants %% . Like other large Valley companies , Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation , so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch . That 's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp. , Houston , which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
plant.n | 1 | General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division , reacting to slow sales , said it will offer $ 800 rebates on its 1990 Beretta , the two-door version of its core compact-car line . Sluggish sales of the Beretta , and its four-door sister car , the Corsica , prompted GM to idle the two %% plants %% that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month . The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet , but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6 % for the year , and fell a steep 34 % during early October . Chevrolet already is offering an $ 800 rebate on the 1990-model Corsica .
plant.n | 1 | Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed . Trading on little specific information , market players overnight in Tokyo began bidding up oil prices . The rally spread into European markets , where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the San Francisco area 's large oil refining %% plants %% . By yesterday morning , much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone . West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets .

plant.n | 1 | When Nucor Corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first thin-slab plant this month , it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors . The new technology , which creates a very thin piece of steel , radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets . An ebullient Kenneth Iverson , Nucor 's chairman , says the company 's %% plant %% eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill . `` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us , '' Mr. Iverson beams . `` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely .

Nucor 's plant in Crawfordsville , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be years before such %% plants %% can compete in the high-profit market . Still , flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter , representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year . Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches .

When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly , Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing %% plant %% nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes . Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers . For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled .

Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday , the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4 % . The DAX dropped 19.69 %% points %% Friday to 1462.93 . Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation , were responsible .

Led by its oat-based Cheerios line , General Mills has gained an estimated 2 % share so far this year , mostly at the expense of Kellogg . Each share %% point %% is worth about $ 60 million in sales . Analysts say much of Kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes , Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes , which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume . Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents , trade sources say .

'' He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage %% point %% a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter .

But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger 's personal letters . He distinguished the two cases : In Salinger , Judge Leval noted , the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving %% points %% about the subject . Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials . Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller 's quotations from Mr. Hubbard 's unpublished writings , because they were not necessary to prove historical points , failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright .

Nervousness that the market has n't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace , as did anticipation of a report on the economy 's third-quarter performance . The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which plunged more than 80 %% points %% in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close , fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session .

Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 %% points %% it did . With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said .

'' Indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche . The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two %% points %% of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other .

Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 %% points %% on the day .

point.n | 14 | Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services . In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed . Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage %% point %% to the downward bias in the growth rate . In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP . For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point .

A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 %% point %% drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another . Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out . The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation .

point.n | 14 | That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street . But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . `` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis %% points %% ( 0.25 percentage point ) becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant . `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance .

Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management . The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .

point.n | 14 | The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 . Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data . For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage %% points %% in either direction . The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger . In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings .

In Paris , Air France declined to comment . `` Nothing is defined or signed at this %% point %% , '' Mr. Daly said of the talks . Whatever accord the three carriers reach , he said , he is skeptical it would create a separate airline . If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses , their clout would be considerable .

'' The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide . The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 %% points %% lower at 2638.73 . `` This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist for Mellon Bank . `` It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them .

point.n | 14 | Harold Jones , Lincoln 's chief retail banking officer , said there has n't yet been `` a discernible response , '' although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week . Friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way . First National Bank of Boston , for example , is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage %% point %% on six-month and 12-month CDs . Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week . New York 's Citibank , for instance , increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8 % from 7.9 % .
point.n | 14 | CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks . `` What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit '' reported yesterday `` make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote . `` Even before the market drop , rates were down about half a percentage %% point %% , '' said Robert J. Hutchinson , senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York . `` That puts pressure on CD rates .
point.n | 14 | Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile ? Yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance : It plunged 60.25 %% points %% before lunch , with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes . Then , it rebounded to finish down only 18.65 points . And those swings paled beside Friday 's 190.58-point plunge and Monday 's 88.12-point recovery .

's 14 1\/2 % subordinated debentures , rose . The Macy 's issue closed up about one %% point %% at a bid price of 97 . The TVA 's public debt offering was its first in 15 years . Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion .
point.n | 14 | Municipals Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena , as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds . Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3\/8 %% point %% lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading . Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc. , as agent for a customer , will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues .

Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates . The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking %% points %% in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters . In 1986 , India signed a $ 1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , to purchase 400 artillery pieces . The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs .
point.n | 14 | But stocks later recovered , erasing most of their early declines . That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday 's levels . The Dow Jones Industrial Average , down more than 60.25 points early in the day , finished 18.65 %% points %% lower at 2638.73 . Long-term Treasury issues declined about half a point , or $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount . `` The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets , '' said Jack Conlon , an executive vice president at Nikko Securities .

point.n | 5 | The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05 , or 0.2 % , to 459.93 . The action was confined to Nasdaq 's biggest and most liquid stocks , traders said . The Nasdaq 100 Index began the day at 449.89 , lost 2 % at one %% point %% , and was up 0.4 % at another . The barometer of the biggest nonfinancial stocks settled at 448.49 , off 1.40 . Its counterpart , the Nasdaq Financial Index , was weak for most of the day , sliding 2.51 to 453.57 by the end of trading .
point.n | 14 | The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago . The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index %% point %% under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held . For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market .
point.n | 14 | The contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the Merc to stem a market slide . But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply higher . The market hovered near Friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour , moving several index %% points %% higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back . The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts . `` Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said one S&P 500 broker .

A minute later it soared 128 %% points %% , then zoomed back down 113 points , 69 below Friday 's close . `` It was crazy , '' said Neil Weisman , general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp . `` It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . ''
point.n | 14 | It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average . At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points . Actually , it was down only a few %% points %% at the time . Quotron said that snafu , which lasted nine minutes , resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at Philip Morris Cos . A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems .

Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says $ 1.15 million `` would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago .

point.n | 4 | In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama . The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega . The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 %% points %% necessary to justify U.S. support . So far no one has . The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 .
point.n | 3 | Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium . Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz 's sense that the 1974 `` Music in Twelve Parts '' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` The Well-Tempered Clavier . '' But while making the obvious %% point %% that both composers develop variations from themes , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass 's music . Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky , the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler . Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review .
policy.n | 1 | A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) , who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush 's handling of the Soviet relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting . But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of %% policy %% . '' Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers . `` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. Bush said .
policy.n | 1 | Mr. Mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . '' Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing . Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , who had dissented from the Treasury 's %% policy %% , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . '' Intervention , he added , is useful only to smooth disorderly markets , not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value . Rep. John LaFalce ( D. , N.Y . ) said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony .
policy.n | 1 | It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems ( `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone %% Policy %% ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 ) . To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted . Consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure .
policy.n | 1 | The chamber also sent to Bush a nearly $ 67 billion fiscal 1990 measure that includes the first construction funds for a space station . Nicaragua 's Ortega postponed until today a decision on whether to end a 19-month-old cease-fire in the conflict with the Contra rebels . In Washington , the Senate voted to condemn Ortega 's threat to cancel the truce , and Bush said he would review U.S. %% policy %% toward Managua , including the possibility of renewing military aid to the rebels . Chinese leader Deng told former President Nixon that the U.S. was deeply involved in `` the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion '' that gripped Beijing last spring . Nixon , on the fourth day of a private visit to China , said that damage to Sino-U.S. relations was `` very great , '' calling the situation `` the most serious '' since 1972 .
policy.n | 2 | In another development yesterday , creditors were told that $ 40 million they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize , according to one source . Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $ 20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said . And plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance %% policy %% have hit a snag , the source said . An Eastern spokesman said `` the $ 40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern 's plan . Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant . ''
policy.n | 1 | By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher , and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods , Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party . At the same time , the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism . The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's %% policy %% for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism . An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendencies '' and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims . It is possible that , in perpetuating such myths , the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism .
policy.n | 1 | Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled . Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch . But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen %% policy %% , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing . In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .
policy.n | 1 | Margaret Thatcher 's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual . That may be the last thing she needs . As the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its %% policies %% . The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again . Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration , beginning with the European Monetary System , which Britain is committed to joining fully someday .
policy.n | 1 | There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad . After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting %% policy %% on covert activities . If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years . Over the past week , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
policy.n | 1 | Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy . As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining . Until his resignation , Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary %% policy %% as if the pound were tied to the mark . When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40 % , Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark . As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .
policy.n | 1 | To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary %% policy %% . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
policy.n | 1 | First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction . Then , when the currency falls , interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate . This %% policy %% is totally mindless , and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies . Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany . A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state .
policy.n | 1 | As in the U.S. , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever . At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a %% policy %% Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS . Faced with a similar situation , Paul Volcker let the dollar soar , ( though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation ) .
policy.n | 1 | In particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility . All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy . Better to have a true monetarist %% policy %% , just for the experience . So Mr. Lawson had to resign . In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan 's autobiography in The American Economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal .
policy.n | 1 | As far as the pound goes , some traders say a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week . While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition . Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a %% policy %% squabble with other cabinet members . He was succeeded by John Major , who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation . But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency analysts contend .

policy.n | 1 | MEDICINE SHOPPE INTERNATIONAL Inc. declared a 3-for-2 stock split , and substantially boosted the dividend payout . The franchiser of pharmacies said the added shares will be distributed Dec. 4 to stock of record Nov. 13 . The company also changed its dividend %% policy %% , under which holders had received an annual 10 cents-a-share payment , by declaring a four-cents-a-share dividend , to be paid quarterly on post-split shares .
policy.n | 1 | The statement was the U.S. government 's first acknowledgement of what other groups , such as the International Monetary Fund , have been predicting for months . Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate . The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate %% policies %% . `` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates . The Treasury expressed pleasure , however , with the government of Taiwan , which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year 's report .
policy.n | 1 | Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn . Moreover , state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say . The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government %% policy %% . In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard . At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation .
policy.n | 1 | Mr. Boren himself did n't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week . It 's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire . A former Oklahoma governor , he 's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign %% policy %% . He 's a rare Democratic hawk . He 's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg , the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s .
policy.n | 1 | The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key 2.90-mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks late Wednesday . Mr. Lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Indeed , only hours earlier , Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson 's economic %% policies %% `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him . `` There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst , '' said Patrick Foley , deputy chief economic adviser for Lloyds Bank in London . `` The resignation came as a great surprise . ''
policy.n | 1 | But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead , commenting that Mr. Major shares `` a very similar view of the world '' with Mr. Lawson . Bob Chandross , chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York , also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies . Unless Mr. Lawson 's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate %% policy %% -- Mrs. Thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System 's exchange-rate mechanism , Mr. Lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates , Mr. Chandross concluded . Also announcing his resignation Thursday was Alan Walters , Mrs. Thatcher 's economic adviser and Mr. Lawson 's nemesis . The pound , which had been trading at about $ 1.6143 in New York prior to Mr. Lawson 's announcement , sank more than two cents to $ 1.5930 , prompting the Federal Reserve Bank to buy pounds for dollars .

The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations , but says : `` We 're talking %% policy %% limits . '' In this case , that 's about $ 250,000 . It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos , an affluent community in Santa Clara County , may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay .

U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export -- cut flowers -- into the American market .

I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by The Wall Street Journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper , to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs . Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge .
policy.n | 1 | When President Bush travels to Costa Rica today , he 'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels . But the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's %% policies %% in Central America . Some conservatives say Mr. Bush should n't make the trip , during which he will participate in Costa Rica 's celebration of 100 years of democracy . These critics object to Mr. Bush 's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests .
policy.n | 1 | The catalyst for all this has been OPEC . About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession . Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , abandoned a %% policy %% of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters . About the same time , the Iran-Iraq war , which was roiling oil markets , ended . In addition , global petroleum demand has been climbing .
policy.n | 1 | But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 . After that , it will make a final decision on the %% policy %% . The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start-up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture-capital firm . With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .

policy.n | 1 | Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C. ) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years . `` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee . The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) and Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary %% policy %% moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed . In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy . `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .
policy.n | 1 | Even that met with Mr. Greenspan 's disapproval because it might subject the Fed `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals . '' While each of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals represents only a small step , together they would erode the Fed 's independence , Mr. Greenspan said . Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic %% policy %% , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates .
policy.n | 1 | The dollar is still highly volatile . The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic %% policies %% . Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . '' The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .

policy.n | 1 | Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains . In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . '' The guidelines also state , `` The government 's %% policy %% is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . '' Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax-fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case . Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants .
policy.n | 1 | The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies ( such as bonds ) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction . 2 . In seeking approval of a TRO , the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties , balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets . 3 . In deciding whether forfeiture ( and , hence , a TRO ) is appropriate , the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; the government 's %% policy %% is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . 4 . When a RICO TRO is being sought , the prosecutor is required , at the earliest appropriate time , to state publicly that the government 's request for a TRO , and eventual forfeiture , is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is , in requesting the TRO , the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant ; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them ; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties ; and will , in all other respects , assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected , through proceeding under { RICO } and otherwise . The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO .

Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal , and were meant to break even financially . Since the 1950s , federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rates , and %% policy %% applications , spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular . As we will see , many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit . But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control .

policy.n | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO %% policy %% is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .

policy.n | 2 | ( Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . ) Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say . Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard %% policies %% as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage . Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
policy.n | 2 | Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies . Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies . Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some %% policies %% directly to consumers . Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada . But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented .
policy.n | 1 | Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed . At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating . Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit %% policy %% stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy .

So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen.

The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of %% policies %% to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
policy.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic %% policy %% as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
policy.n | 2 | Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish . Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . Besides term life and whole life ( the old standbys ) , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , %% policies %% with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on . What to do ? First , generalize .
policy.n | 2 | What to do ? First , generalize . Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the %% policy %% and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive . If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
policy.n | 2 | Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older . So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : %% policies %% structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
policy.n | 2 | This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . The implication is that your permanent-insurance %% policy %% is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature . That is gilding the lily . The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
policy.n | 2 | And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this . So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment . The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life %% policy %% . You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years . One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life ( you pay for the whole policy at once ) , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
policy.n | 2 | However , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences . But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small . I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a %% policy %% immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life . Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life . I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
policy.n | 2 | And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments . So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these %% policy %% riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive . Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
policy.n | 2 | But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes . And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate %% policy %% that provides it . I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life . Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
policy.n | 2 | Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot . I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen . After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas %% policy %% with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable . The difference is magnified by time , too . At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .

He was later shown on television , fielding questions . At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel %% policies %% . The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ''

Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary %% policy %% to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . '' Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary . And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .
policy.n | 1 | First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national %% policy %% making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat . The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
policy.n | 1 | This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national %% policy %% making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff . An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) .

Furthermore , it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas . The sad condition of U.S. %% policy %% in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica . In 1984 , the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country , flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda . Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica , funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America ( VOA ) .

Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic %% policy %% address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .

In Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
policy.n | 1 | On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10 % a year . In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period . The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary %% policy %% . At least , it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period . And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve .
policy.n | 1 | The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience . There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years : 1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary %% policy %% could yield a net improvement in employment and output . 2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it . Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
policy.n | 1 | What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy , which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level . To leave this decision to an `` independent '' agency is not only undemocratic . It also prevents the conduct of a %% policy %% that has a long-term rationale , because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters , the politicians , who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy . The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System . Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C . ) .

The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon 's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which owns the largest share of Seabrook , and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation . Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC %% policy %% that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions . In its ruling , the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs , consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless . `` The commissioners found the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation , '' said a commission spokesman .

'' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
policy.n | 1 | Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual `` Mansion House '' address to the financial community . The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes . Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address , given Mr. Lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust %% policy %% currently . Meanwhile , Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency . Japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 % .
policy.n | 2 | In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer , Travelers Cos. , the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country . Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies . They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit ; thus , such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the %% policies %% , the insurers say . The appeals court disagreed on both counts . Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant .
policy.n | 1 | A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides . The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 . The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture %% policy %% than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .
policy.n | 1 | Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget . The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary %% policy %% . Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . '' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
policy.n | 1 | Rep. Bill McCollum ( R. , Fla. ) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics . In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose %% policies %% are anathema to the Afghan public . This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders . In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates .
policy.n | 1 | The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further . It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1\/4 percentage point to about 8 3\/4 % from its previous target level of about 9 % . The rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in Fed %% policy %% . It ended at about 8 11\/16 % yesterday , but was as low as 8 1\/2 % Monday . The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\/2 point , or over $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since Thursday .
policy.n | 1 | Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades . America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship . Before American foreign %% policy %% set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates . For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period .
policy.n | 2 | Paramedics were called . A week later , the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . `` It was a powerful point in my career , '' says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis , who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability %% policy %% for his business . `` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage . The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her .
position.n | 4 | The State of Wisconsin Investment Board , which owned about 7 % of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill . This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders . The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors , as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock %% positions %% . More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team 's strategy . Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills .
position.n | 4 | Many of the morning-session winners turned out to be losers by afternoon . In other stock-market news , the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that for the week ended Friday , the balance of margin buying rose 189.8 billion yen ( $ 1.34 billion ) , to 7.160 trillion yen ( $ 50.46 billion ) . The balance of short %% positions %% outstanding fell 159.7 billion yen , to 779.8 billion yen . In London , prices finished at intraday peaks , comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its `` golden share '' in auto maker Jaguar . But trading was very sketchy , as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks .
position.n | 5 | W. Ed Tyler , 37 years old , a senior vice president at this printing concern , was elected president of its technology group , a new %% position %% .
position.n | 2 | After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats . Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and %% positions %% with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year . The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus . Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance .
position.n | 2 | The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold Ford liable in the case . In a statement , Young & Rubicam called the award `` unfortunate but bearable . '' Peter Laird , a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler , said , `` We believe that the verdict reaffirms her %% position %% and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers . That is a property right that belongs to the performer . '' The award , although far less than the $ 10 million , including punitive damages , that Ms. Midler sought , is likely to force Madison Avenue to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads .
position.n | 2 | Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . '' Yesterday , Joel Zweibel , an attorney for Eastern 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to . He said only that the committee has not yet taken any %% position %% on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating . `` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said . Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size .
position.n | 3 | The latter would be undertaken by `` enterprises , joint stock companies and cooperatives . '' These would not function independently , but would act together to form `` combines , unions and associations '' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities . Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger %% position %% to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini , who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat . The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it . To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition .
position.n | 5 | Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional %% position %% . And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
position.n | 4 | Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation , were responsible . Traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest . They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square %% positions %% ahead of the weekend . `` It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us , '' said Valentin Von Korff , a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt . `` If you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap .
position.n | 2 | Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your %% position %% that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ? The Moloch that knows no God but more ? ''
position.n | 4 | Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others . Westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing . In the past , the company usually took token equity %% positions %% in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals . But last June 's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $ 70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age . Westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co .
position.n | 5 | Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . '' The move , which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 42.5 million ) in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. Maier said . All 700 Toronto-based employees will be offered %% positions %% in Calgary , the company said . The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added . Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .
position.n | 3 | According to the Value Line Investment Survey , demand for Nekoosa 's commodity paper has weakened , prompting earnings to decline by 6.6 % in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 . Value Line added , `` With discounts widening on business papers , and with newsprint and corrugated shipments flat , we expect negative earnings comparisons through next year . '' By contrast , Value Line said Georgia-Pacific `` is in a comparatively good %% position %% to deal with weakening paper markets , '' because its production is concentrated not in the Northwest but in the South , where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices . Also , it is n't exposed to the weakening newsprint business , and is strong in the less-cyclical tissue business . The purchase of Nekoosa would easily eclipse Georgia-Pacific 's $ 530 million acquisition of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. last year .
position.n | 2 | Scenario 1 , known as the `` Constant Dollar Freeze , '' reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4 % per year . This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985 , and it reduces the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994 . Scenario 3 , the `` Current Dollar Freeze , '' has been the approximate %% position %% of the House of Representatives for about four years . It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 . This reduces the baseline by $ 229 billion .
position.n | 3 | In its report to Congress on international economic policies , the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade , known as the current account , `` is likely at best to be very modest , '' and `` the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded . '' The statement was the U.S. government 's first acknowledgement of what other groups , such as the International Monetary Fund , have been predicting for months . Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade %% position %% may deteriorate . The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies . `` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates .
position.n | 4 | `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said . But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session . That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial %% positions %% of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
position.n | 2 | Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim . On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan 's Columbus Circle . But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his %% position %% . Says one city official : `` Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal . He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster . ''
position.n | 3 | CAMBREX Corp. , Bayonne , N.J. , declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 . The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding . The company said the move recognizes its strong financial %% position %% . Although profits were `` squeezed '' in 1989 , mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs , the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond . In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $ 13 a share .
position.n | 4 | The fallout for investors lately has been painful . Consider the New America High Income Fund . With a leveraged %% position %% of about 45 % , the fund 's share price has plunged 28.5 % so far this year . That 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total return ( bond-price changes plus interest ) has amounted to a negative 6.08 % . Such problems may not be over .
position.n | 4 | But a few funds have taken other defensive steps . Some have raised their cash positions to record levels . High cash %% positions %% help buffer a fund when the market falls . Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year , says John Frabotta , portfolio co-manager . He says the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .
position.n | 3 | Last Monday , Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets . Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to Qintex Entertainment . Separately , a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment 's financial %% position %% . Qintex Australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .
position.n | 5 | C. Hyde Tucker will become president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic International Inc. , a unit of this telecommunications concern , effective Jan. 1 . Mr. Tucker , 56 years old , is currently vice president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic 's C&P Telephone unit . Mr. Tucker will succeed Salvatore J. Barbera , 64 , who will hold the newly created %% position %% of chairman of the international unit until his retirement April 1 .
position.n | 5 | C.B. Rogers Jr. was named chief executive officer of this business information concern . Mr. Rogers , 60 years old , succeeds J.V. White , 64 , who will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee . Mr. Rogers , who was president and chief operating officer of Equifax , will retain his %% position %% as president . The company said a new chief operating officer wo n't be appointed .
position.n | 2 | `` In all honesty if you ask me , ` Is this man a true believer ? ' I do n't know , '' says John Fowler , head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc . Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's %% position %% on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention . He 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
position.n | 2 | These days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness . Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance . `` My %% position %% is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied . A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. Bush has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue . In 1974 , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations , he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor .
position.n | 5 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been president since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the %% position %% to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units . `` It certainly was n't intended to be a demotion , '' the spokesman said .
position.n | 5 | The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his %% position %% to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months . The emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway funds , and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road , such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week 's earthquake . The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and , since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1 , only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law .
position.n | 5 | He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit . Mr. Roy could n't be reached . Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo , a new %% position %% . Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo 's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit . Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo 's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold , after a which a new chief executive will be named .
position.n | 3 | Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites , the Office of Thrift Supervision said . But that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks , the agency said . The office , an arm of the Treasury , said it does n't have data on the financial %% position %% of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often . Nevertheless , on Capitol Hill , where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing , lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities . They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws .
position.n | 3 | Prosecutors wanted $ 23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ 400,000 . The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank . Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges `` which the company is not in a %% position %% to dispute '' because of RICO . Part of Drexel 's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose . So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what , if anything , Drexel did wrong .
position.n | 2 | The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing . Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government . But the stated U.S. %% position %% is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling . The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident . Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday .
position.n | 4 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short %% position %% change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 ( see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 ) .
position.n | 3 | Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive %% position %% . Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack . And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
position.n | 3 | Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it . Consistently , D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form . When most spectators thought its %% position %% hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down . Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision . While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
position.n | 3 | On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly . He won D.T. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this %% position %% , to give the computer much hope . In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move . And Mr. Kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room .
position.n | 4 | They might even step up sales in a falling market , he said , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries . Technically , Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level . When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their %% positions %% . Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders .
position.n | 4 | Program trading amounted to 12.3 % of average daily volume in June . The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks . The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the %% position %% with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits . It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market . Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September , but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage .
position.n | 4 | The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 . London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their %% positions %% and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . Fund selling also picked up at that point . According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
position.n | 5 | Randolph W. McElroy , a vice chairman of this bank-holding company , was named to the additional %% position %% of chairman of its principal unit , Sovran Bank . Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit . Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 .
position.n | 3 | General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong %% positions %% in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
position.n | 1 | The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees . The study was done by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide . What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic %% positions %% of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa . Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks . Mr. Barre 's rule is crumbling fast .
position.n | 3 | At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its %% position %% as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' The Qintex Australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing . He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
position.n | 2 | The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration . The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution . The vote , in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's %% position %% , was a victory for Democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights . `` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine . In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley ( D. , Wash . ) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
position.n | 4 | Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated . By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today . `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI %% positions %% , Mr. Selkin said . Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . Philip Morris added 1 1\/8 to 44 1\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3\/8 to 70 3\/8 , Merck gained 1 3\/8 to 77 3\/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7\/8 to 43 3\/8 on 2.5 million shares .
position.n | 2 | SciMed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings . In national over-the-counter trading Friday , SciMed shares tumbled $ 2.75 to $ 43 . SciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its %% position %% that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts .
position.n | 3 | Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale . The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining %% position %% with the board . However , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
position.n | 5 | Also , Larry A. Kushkin , executive vice president , North American operations , was named head of the company 's international automotive operations , another new position . He remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . '' Gordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations , and Mr. Kushkin 's former %% position %% is n't being filled at this time , the company said .
position.n | 3 | Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach , Calif. , thrift . Mercury , which has assets of more than $ 2 billion and 24 branches in California , said the action to improve its regulatory capital %% position %% is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation . Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco . Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ 4.875 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
position.n | 1 | If a customer asks for stories about `` IBM , '' the computer will also supply stories that mention `` I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , '' Mr. Amram says . Moreover , Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest area . It compares the %% position %% of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value . And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire data base . The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
position.n | 5 | Marginal operations and assets have been sold . The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage %% positions %% have been eliminated . Even perks have been reduced . For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
position.n | 2 | Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor . It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate . `` He does n't know himself , '' Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's %% position %% . Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence . `` He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life .
position.n | 2 | Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 . You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls . My %% position %% is one founded on both the facts and the law . Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling ( and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative ) . The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .

Nelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis , to 1,000 shares from 255,923 . The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest %% position %% of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September .

position.n | 5 | Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday . ( Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media . ) ADN said Mr. Honecker , a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his %% position %% as chief of the military . Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week . Mr. Honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker , now 77 years old , built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc .
position.n | 6 | Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership %% position %% in the coffee business . But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers . `` Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .
position.n | 6 | Both will report to Tim Breene , a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency . In an interview in New York , Mr. Breene , fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night , outlined big plans for the new agency . `` Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 %% position %% ... by the end of three years from now . It implies very dramatic growth , '' he said . He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of # 100 million for acquisitions .
position.n | 5 | Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line . `` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says George Palmatier , a Minden , Nev. , sales consultant and author of `` The Marketing Edge . '' Still , says John Sullivan , a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston , who has held senior sales %% positions %% at Polaroid and Atari : `` The customer will react to strength . Ignore the present condition . Show it 's business as usual . ''
position.n | 4 | The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved , too . Microsoft advanced 1 7\/8 to 80 1\/2 and Lotus Development added 1 1\/4 to 32 1\/2 . In other earthquake-related news , Hambrecht & Quist 's OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its %% positions %% were frozen for the day by the National Association of Securities Dealers . Power could n't be restored at the company 's San Francisco headquarters to allow trading yesterday morning . In New York , Roger Killion , a Hambrecht executive vice president , said he expects OTC trading at the company to resume this morning , either in New York or in San Francisco .
position.n | 4 | An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday , but profit-taking on short %% positions %% helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts . While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows . Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen .
position.n | 4 | In the first hour of trading , about one million shares a minute changed hands on the Big Board as big stock-index arbitrage sell programs pushed prices lower . ( In stock-index arbitrage , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks against offsetting positions in futures . ) Traders said many of the sell programs are %% positions %% being established ahead of this Friday 's expiration . Aside from computer-guided selling , airline stocks took a beating as well . The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 49.96 to close at 1254.27 .
position.n | 3 | Ratings under review are Ryder 's A-1 collateral trust debentures , A-2 senior notes and bonds , A-2 preferred stock and the company 's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper . Moody 's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets . The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs , improve margins and enhance its competitive %% position %% in its primary business , vehicle leasing and rental .
position.n | 5 | The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation . In addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level %% positions %% to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world . The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer , who will be hired from within the agency . IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year .
position.n | 5 | SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc . Thomas E. Meador , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co. , a Skokie , Ill. , subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm . Balcor , which has interests in real estate , said the %% position %% is newly created . Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor . In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management .
position.n | 5 | Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company . He retains his current %% positions %% as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures .
position.n | 4 | As the stock market bounced back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday , when investors dumped $ 2.3 billion , or about 2 % of stock-fund assets . Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , said phone volume was more than double its typical level , but still half that of Oct. 19 , 1987 . Net outflows from Fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ 300 million , or below 15 % of the $ 2 billion cash %% position %% of the firm 's stock portfolios . Much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds . Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago , Fidelity said .

power.n | 1 | In 1983 , Texas Air 's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy . Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy . `` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample %% power %% to block undesirable deals .
power.n | 1 | In a statement , Jaguar 's board said they `` were not consulted about the ( Ridley decision ) in advance and were surprised at the action taken . '' The statement emphasized that holders representing 75 % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions . Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the %% power %% to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management .
power.n | 1 | Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership . We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform . This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the %% power %% of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries . Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home . The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation .
power.n | 3 | Sales amounted to 1.011 trillion yen , climbing 29 % from 787.02 billion yen . Encouraged by the brisk performance , Mitsubishi plans to raise its per-share dividend to 3.50 yen from three yen . Company officials said the current robust domestic demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion helped push up sales of products like ships , steel structures , %% power %% systems and machinery and resulted in sharply higher profit .
power.n | 1 | If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal %% power %% , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika . Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform . But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
power.n | 1 | These would not function independently , but would act together to form `` combines , unions and associations '' to tackle problems and coordinate their activities . Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini , who was never able to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat . The Soviet Communist Party has the %% power %% to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it . To ensure the loyalty of the business sector , Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests , probably by restricting competition . However , Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this `` alliance '' the business sector remains subordinate to the party .
power.n | 3 | The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire , their regular-season leader with 33 , and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt . `` Think I 'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove , '' quipped the big first baseman Saturday night , fingering the gold bat he wears on a neck chain . Even with that %% power %% show , though , the Oakland Series ' star , certified by the Most Valuable Player award , was a pitcher , Dave Stewart . He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One , and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake . Stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds .
power.n | 3 | In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals . But last June 's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $ 70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age . Westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical %% power %% to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co . `` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says Theodore Stern , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group . At the same time , Westinghouse hopes its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the U.S. , from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG , Siemens AG , and British General Electric Co .
power.n | 3 | Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear %% power %% plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .

One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices . For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s , the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global %% power %% and fame . The Arabs had merely oil . These farmers may have a grip on the world 's very heart .
power.n | 3 | ABB Asea Brown Boveri B.V. said it signed a contract for the largest-ever power plant order in the Netherlands . ABB said the contract , signed with the Dutch utility N.V . Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA , is valued in excess of $ 200 million . The accord is for a turbogenerator plant at the coal-fired %% power %% station Hemweg in Amsterdam . ABB Asea Brown Boveri is the Dutch unit of the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG . ABB said a significant portion of the order will be placed with Dutch subcontractors , adding that a group has been set up for this purpose .
power.n | 1 | It 's the line-item veto , a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill . Whatever one thinks of the idea , it 's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance . Rather , it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress , fundamentally enhance the %% power %% of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business . President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president . Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress -- which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks .
power.n | 1 | `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' In addition to giving a president %% powers %% to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
power.n | 1 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary %% power %% could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed . He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
power.n | 1 | It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses . They , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares . The Fed also has the %% power %% to set margin requirements . But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ? Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
power.n | 2 | But in 1989 most senators have other ideas . Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama . Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt , a charming notion for a great %% power %% . Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban . So the administration dropped it .
power.n | 1 | The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992 , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures . Some forms of private property would be sanctioned . Such moves would greatly reduce the %% power %% of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform . -- FINANCES . Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit .
power.n | 1 | As opposed to the $ 1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season , the 1988-89 year concluded with a $ 200,000 surplus and a $ 500,000 cash reserve . Admittedly last season 's runaway hit , `` Steel Magnolias , '' helped a lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board . Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder , Nina Vance , was at the height of her %% powers %% . But it is clear he is going to give it a shot .
power.n | 1 | Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop . Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything else , Presidents must have the chance to veto . Labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca n't deprive the President of his %% power %% to veto items . Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible . The White House had the perfect case , but Congress blinked before it could go to court .
power.n | 1 | The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world . The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain . By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the %% power %% to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union . The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency . It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined .
power.n | 3 | The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides %% power %% to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
power.n | 3 | The two-stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries , the maker of Subaru cars , drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives , who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines . Honda Motor Co. shows a more conventional five-cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model , which made its debut just this month -- in Japan only . Honda says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder , and the %% power %% of a V-6 . It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury Acura line in the U.S. , but Honda officials would n't comment . Odd Cars , Funny Names
power.n | 1 | Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much . Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea . That may have pleased the secretary , but H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. , suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the %% power %% he needs . Like most treasury secretaries , Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course . He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury .
power.n | 2 | France voted the same as the U.S. 76 % of the time , West Germany 79 % and Britain 83 % . Larry Birns , director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs , a liberal research group , said that Latin American countries would be `` profoundly disappointed '' if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS . `` Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist %% power %% that respects their sovereignty , '' he said . The OAS , which tries to promote peace and economic development within the Americas , is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis . Cuba has been suspended from OAS membership , but the organization 's members are discussing Cuba 's reinstatement .
power.n | 3 | Robert L. Wood , 37-year-old chief financial officer , was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent %% power %% producer , succeeding Raymond L. Hixson , 63 . Mr. Hixson , who resigned effective Jan. 1 for health reasons , remains a director .
power.n | 1 | THE HOUSE FAILED to override Bush 's veto of a bill easing abortion funding . The chamber voted 231-191 , 51 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the president 's veto of legislation renewing support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest . The roll call was considered an illustration of the limits of %% power %% that the resurgent abortion-rights movement faces . The legislation was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health . Michigan 's Senate passed a bill requiring girls to get parental consent for an abortion and Pennsylvania 's House cleared a measure banning abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy .
power.n | 3 | In addition to owning HBO , with 22 million subscribers , Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers . Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million . In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market %% power %% . Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite . Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business .
power.n | 1 | An estimated $ 38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner , the House chairman . And $ 70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat , Sen. James Sasser . Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska , Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their %% power %% elsewhere in the appropriations process . Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd ( D. , W.Va . ) even added report language listing $ 49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year . No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D. , Hawaii ) , who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee .
power.n | 3 | Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear %% power %% plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .
power.n | 1 | Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill . He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the %% power %% to exercise a line-item veto . Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , confirming comments made this week by Vice President Dan Quayle , said Mr. Bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case .
power.n | 1 | The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving %% power %% to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .
power.n | 3 | Here , too , Mr. Roberts is way off the mark . The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years . Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the %% power %% sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies . By and large , these efforts have borne fruit . In my home region , Latin America , much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank .
power.n | 3 | More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . In contrast , dashboard computers , %% power %% seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days . GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option .
power.n | 3 | National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4-kilobit memory , next year . Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market . In addition to not needing an outside %% power %% source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips . Military buyers have shown interest , National says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation . And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
power.n | 3 | AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for %% power %% semiconductors in January . The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field . AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
power.n | 3 | TVA , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week . Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion . TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric %% power %% systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction .
power.n | 3 | But Conner is n't standing still . Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
power.n | 1 | But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted . In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee , First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate . First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the SEC has the %% power %% to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities . `` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' Michael Raoul-Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview . The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said .
power.n | 3 | Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing %% power %% of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . Risk is also a function of time . When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
power.n | 1 | Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate , which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women . Reversing an eight-year federal policy , the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest , but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger . Mr. Bush 's veto %% power %% puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House , but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill . The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State , Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990 . An estimated $ 1.32 billion is provided for next year 's census , and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens .
power.n | 1 | When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping %% power %% to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors . Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
power.n | 3 | `` I guess I thought , ` This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out ! ' '' Here in the Global Village , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long . Electrical %% power %% was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful . Within a few minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear . Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 , then 6.9 , then 7.0 .
power.n | 1 | The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical . The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government . The Fed exercises a %% power %% given to it by Congress and the president . But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed . Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
power.n | 3 | MACPOST : Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worst off . No %% power %% , minimal phones , and a mess of mayonnaise , wine , and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People 's Co-op . The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals , and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk . It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
power.n | 3 | The transactions are unrelated . The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V . Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for %% power %% generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill . That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp . Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
power.n | 2 | Recall that Nicaragua 's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates . Within two years , the moderates were exiled or in prison , Nicaragua had gone communist , and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors . In Laos , when the Western %% powers %% bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination . Even Mao Tse-tung 's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller , non-communist parties . What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist , as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi , as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups .
power.n | 3 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out %% power %% lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
power.n | 1 | Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker . '' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of %% power %% with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party .
power.n | 3 | When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air . Michael L. Bandler , vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . The battery packs have enough %% power %% for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network , only four went down . One of those was in Hollister , Calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter .
power.n | 3 | `` Property values did n't go up in California yesterday , '' says one money manager . Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to $ 19.625 . One of its %% power %% generators was damaged , though the company said there wo n't be any financial impact . Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to $ 44.625 . A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement , and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines .
power.n | 3 | `` I 'm happy and sad , '' he said . Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view . Having argued that Galileo 's plutonium %% power %% source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday , they were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch . Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter . The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then .
power.n | 3 | Japanese machinery makers received orders totaling 1.465 trillion yen ( $ 10.33 billion ) in August , up 14 % from a year earlier , the Economic Planning Agency said . `` Equipment orders on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and %% power %% utilities , '' said an agency official . The latest report compares with a modest 9.9 % increase in July machinery orders from a year earlier .
power.n | 1 | Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation . The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the %% power %% to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low .
power.n | 3 | AMERICAN BUILDING MAINTENANCE INDUSTRIES Inc. , San Francisco , provider of maintenance services , annual revenue of $ 582 million , NYSE , had some damage to headquarters and lost phone service , but operations were moved to a branch office and are running smoothly thanks to a decentralized computer system the company had developed before the quake . AMERICAN PRESIDENT COS. , Oakland , shipping concern , annual sales of $ 2.2 billion , NYSE , had little damage to the cranes , dock or rail track at its container-ship facility near the collapsed Route 880 overpass . The company expects to work a ship due in today with minimal delays , despite sporadic %% power %% . ANACOMP INC. , Indianapolis , NYSE , said its Xidex Corp. unit , a Sunnyvale maker of computer disks and microfilm with annual sales of $ 637 million , had only minor damage and is fully operational . ANTHEM ELECTRONICS INC. , San Jose , distributor of electronic parts , annual sales of about $ 300 million , NYSE , sustained very little damage , anticipated being `` in 100 % operating condition '' by midday .
power.n | 3 | The concern 's National Service Division opened a center for emergency service in Walnut Creek as part of its disaster-recovery plan . KAISER ALUMINUM & CHEMICAL , Oakland , metal and chemical maker , annual sales of $ 2.22 billion , had slight structural damage to its 28-story headquarters building and employees stayed home yesterday to allow crews to clean up . LOCKHEED CORP. , Calabasas , aerospace and defense concern , annual sales of $ 10.59 billion , NYSE , said its Lockheed Missiles & Space division closed its Santa Cruz test facility because of %% power %% outages and landslides . The closing , affecting 266 employees , will continue at least until roads are cleared . It was n't known to what extent , if any , the facility was damaged .
power.n | 3 | RAYCHEM CORP. , Menlo Park , plastics manufacturer , annual sales $ 1 billion , no major damage and no production slowdown is anticipated . ROSS STORES INC. , Newark , discount apparel chain , annual sales $ 576 million , two of 28 stores in Bay Area closed , both could open as early as today . SAFEWAY STORES INC. , Oakland , retail food chain , annual sales of $ 13.6 billion , some structural damage to headquarters and no %% power %% ; major problems transporting products to those stores that remained open ; no numbers on how many stores closed . CHARLES SCHWAB & CO. , San Francisco , discount brokerage firm , annual sales of $ 392 million , had only minor damage to headquarters building and was up and running for yesterday 's market open . Firm will not , however , resume 24-hour service until power in city is restored .
power.n | 1 | It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought . Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts . Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial %% power %% to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers . That 's the conventional theory anyway . In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
power.n | 3 | At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces . The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime base . The resistance lacks not only air %% power %% , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime . Instead , they were pressured by Pakistan 's ISI , the channel for their support , into attacking Jalalabad .
power.n | 1 | In the previous three general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote . In 1971 , the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war . In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in %% power %% , she was restored to office . Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts , the Congress ( I ) will lose big . But if the opposition remains fractured , the Congress ( I ) could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government .
power.n | 3 | Meanwhile , the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists . Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution . But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation ( which , they claim , depletes natural resources ) and nuclear %% power %% ( even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect ) . They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering . New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power .
power.n | 1 | It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain %% power %% . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
power.n | 3 | Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line . `` We wo n't sign any new contracts { with deliveries } beginning earlier than 2000 , '' the Hydro-Quebec official said . He said Hydro-Quebec already has some `` customers in mind '' for the %% power %% that was to be delivered to Maine . `` Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 , '' said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly . Central Maine said it is evaluating `` many energy options '' to make up for the lost future power , including new energy generation and management proposals from New England , and possibly new Canadian purchases .
prepare.v | 2 | EAST GERMANS RALLIED in three cities to demand democratic freedoms . As the country 's new leader , Egon Krenz , %% prepared %% to travel to Moscow today for talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev , hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of Leipzig , Halle and Schwerin to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group . Krenz , however , vowed to preserve the Communist Party 's hold on political power and said East Germans should n't destabilize the nation with unrealistic demands . Communist officials this month have faced nearly daily pro-democracy protests , accompanied by the flight to the West by thousands of East Germans .
prepare.v | 2 | Mobil Corp. is %% preparing %% to slash the size of its work force in the U.S. , possibly as soon as next month , say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy . The size of the cuts is n't known , but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas . Employees have n't yet been notified .
prepare.v | 2 | Video Telecom Corp. , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television . The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines . And it is %% preparing %% to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network . While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper . An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .
prepare.v | 2 | Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again . As the government %% prepares %% to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative . And that , they say , will be good for bonds . `` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities .
prepare.v | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
prepare.v | 2 | And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to %% prepare %% for an IRS audit . Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . Mr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each .
prepare.v | 1 | Mr. Gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to Stikeman , Elliott , one of Canada 's biggest law firms , is advising Pepper Hamilton 's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions . QUOTABLE : In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
prepare.v | 2 | Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera , his former chief of staff , that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos . Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him . Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- %% prepared %% to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988 . During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation , Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans , whom he had helped for so many years , could turn against him . Now , neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out .
prepare.v | 1 | Schopenhauer never learned Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer . Two things contribute to his popularity . First , Carl respects his audience and %% prepares %% his speeches carefully . Even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes . He has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations : `` humility '' will be `` humly '' , `` with '' will be `` w '' , and `` that '' will be `` tt '' .
prepare.v | 1 | But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond . These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally %% prepare %% an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life .
prepare.v | 1 | At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to %% prepare %% tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
prepare.v | 1 | `` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I 'll repeat what I said . I 've come for Pat Conyers ' body '' . In two minutes the body of Tilghman 's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town 's funeral parlor to be %% prepared %% for decent burial . Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight . `` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he 'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .
prepare.v | 1 | The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible . Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors . The cooks had %% prepared %% one of the best meals we 'd had in a long time , and on Montero 's orders had baked enough bread to last the day . Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered . The worst part had been the waiting ; ; although we did n't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .
prepare.v | 1 | Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook 's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner . I sat and watched proceedings . There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , %% prepared %% , and cooked by Viola herself .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group , which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market . Clients include Miller Brewing Co. and General Motors . Mr. Mingo was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday , according to Samuel J. Chisholm , the agency 's %% president %% and chief operating officer . Ad Notes ... . EARNINGS :
president.n | 3 | For his part , Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe . A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) , who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush 's handling of the Soviet relationship , praised the %% president %% for arranging the meeting . But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy . '' Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers .
president.n | 1 | But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble . The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge . Atsushi Muramatsu , Nissan 's executive vice %% president %% for finance , helped set the tone in December 1986 , when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery . `` This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said . Yutaka Kume , who took the helm as Nissan 's president in June 1985 , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . ''
president.n | 2 | As a result , Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence . Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she did n't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege . In 1988 , a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband , Ferdinand Marcos , the ousted %% president %% of the Philippines , fled the Philippines for Hawaii , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $ 100 million from their homeland . Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate , federal prosecutors have charged . Mrs. Marcos 's trial is expected to begin in March .
president.n | 1 | To increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc. 's Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc. , maker of Anne Klein jewelry , are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies . They 're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase . `` We 've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores , '' says Kim Renk , a Swank vice %% president %% . But there are limits . Ms. Renk says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs .
president.n | 1 | The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York 's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all-time high . Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public . `` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says Raymond Pettit , senior vice %% president %% and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group . `` On balance , we think it will be positive . '' But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being .
president.n | 1 | He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania . And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983 , the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him `` one of the best available , '' after interviewing local lawyers . `` He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former %% president %% of Cambria County 's 150-member bar association , who , like most lawyers in Cambria County , refuses to talk about the judge publicly . `` He 's sharp as a tack . He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
president.n | 1 | The incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank . Two years later , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ 10,000 loan was `` absolutely onerous . '' Paul L. Kane , Laurel 's %% president %% at the time , quickly responded . The bank , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by 3.5 % , `` as a concession to you . '' The judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe , he would be far wealthier than he is .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc. , another company controlled by Mr. Hollander . A company spokesman did n't know Mr. Wakeman 's age . James R. Lees , 51 , vice %% president %% of Newport 's European operations , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations , assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes . Arthur B. Crozier , 34 , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John Virtue , who was another of the ousted directors .
president.n | 3 | Employers could also pay a subminimum `` training wage '' for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old , and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers . White House officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage , which Mr. Bush has fought for throughout the year . `` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the nation 's labor laws , said Roger Porter , assistant to the %% president %% for economic and domestic policy . White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage , the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush . The bill vetoed by the president in June , which the House failed to override , would have lifted the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour by late 1991 , with a training wage for up to two months , generally for a worker 's first job .
president.n | 1 | Thomas A. Donovan , 37 years old , formerly vice president , West Coast operations , at this hazardous-waste-site remediation concern , was named executive vice %% president %% and chief operating officer , both newly created posts , and a director , filling a vacancy . Canonie said it anticipates naming Mr. Donovan to succeed Richard F. Brissette , 55 , as president and chief executive officer , effective March 1 . Mr. Brissette will remain a Canonie board member and will be a consultant to the company .
president.n | 1 | William A. Wise , 44 years old , %% president %% of the El Paso Natural Gas Co. unit of this energy and natural-resources concern , was named to the additional post of chief executive officer , succeeding Travis H. Petty , 61 , who continues as a vice chairman of the parent .
president.n | 1 | Raymond E. Ross , 53 years old , formerly group vice president , U.S. plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern , was named senior vice %% president %% , industrial systems , succeeding David A. Entrekin , who resigned Monday .
president.n | 1 | W. Ed Tyler , 37 years old , a senior vice president at this printing concern , was elected %% president %% of its technology group , a new position .
president.n | 1 | John Franco , 47 years old , formerly vice chairman of Capital Holding Corp. and %% president %% of its Accumulation Investment Group , was named chief executive officer of this insurance holding company , effective Dec. 1 , succeeding Robert T. Shaw , who remains chairman . I.C.H. also named Steven B. Bing , 42 , senior vice president since 1986 , as president , succeeding John W. Gardiner , who will join the HMS Acquisition Corp. division of Hicks , Muse & Co. , which has agreed to buy most of I.C.H. 's Denver-based subsidiaries .
president.n | 1 | Roger M. Marino , president , was named to the new post of vice chairman . Michael Ruettgers , who had been executive vice %% president %% , operations , was named president and chief operating officer . EMC manufactures data-storage systems for mainframes and minicomputers .
president.n | 1 | In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries . The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales . But as Bill Austin , Giant 's %% president %% , puts it , `` With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength , the game has changed .
president.n | 1 | In late May , Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5 % to 20 % and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with customers . The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis 's continuing strategy of advertising `` new lower prices '' when allgedly there have n't been price reductions since June 1 . Richard D. Lewis , %% president %% of the 47-store chain , defended the company 's pricing campaign , saying it did n't use `` the misleading expression ` reduced from original prices . ' '' Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion . Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the agency 's policies .
president.n | 3 | BUSH AND GORBACHEV WILL HOLD two days of informal talks next month . The %% president %% said that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda . A simultaneous announcement was made in Moscow . Bush said that neither he nor Gorbachev expected any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
president.n | 1 | The Dallas oil and gas concern said that $ 10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company 's $ 8.1 million of existing bank debt , to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock , and to purchase a 10 % net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders , National Canada Corp . The remaining $ 40 million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions , the company said . Ted Eubank , Coda 's %% president %% , said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point , with 85 % of the company 's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment . The company put up `` virtually all '' of its oil and gas properties as collateral , he said .
president.n | 1 | At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects . Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities . `` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said Rod Young , vice %% president %% of Resource Information Systems Inc. , a Bedford , Mass. , economic-forecasting firm . `` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . '' One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion .
president.n | 1 | A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates . David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy . Robert White , a vice %% president %% and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3\/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13\/16 % . Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system . Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future .
president.n | 1 | The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger . Mercury also is shrinking itself , part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly . Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice %% president %% . As of Sept. 30 , Mercury 's assets were $ 2.25 billion , down from $ 2.62 billion a year ago . For the nine months , Mercury posted a loss of $ 5.4 million , or 86 cents share , against net income of $ 4 million , or 63 cents share , a year earlier .
president.n | 1 | Douglas Stoneman , vice president of Shell Canada , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development . Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards . Instead , Richard Haskayne , %% president %% and chief executive of Interprovincial 's Calgary-based parent , Interhome Energy Inc. , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal . As for Foothills ' pre-emptive bid , Mr. Haskayne said , `` If they think it gives them some kind of priority position , well , that 's their strategy .
president.n | 1 | Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is . Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts . Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers . Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year . Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
president.n | 1 | Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. . And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice . `` We have too many people in our home offices , '' says Yoshio Hatakeyama , the %% president %% of the Japan Management Association . `` Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low . '' With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners .
president.n | 1 | Quotron Systems Inc. plans to cut about 400 , or 16 % , of its 2,500 employees over the next several months . `` This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line '' with revenue , said J. David Hann , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron . The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since October 1987 's stock market crash , the executive added . Quotron , which Citicorp purchased in 1986 , provides price quotations for securities , particularly stocks .
president.n | 1 | Assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $ 5 billion in September , the institute said . Analysts say additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month . At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund group , money funds continue to draw the most business , says Michael Hines , vice %% president %% , marketing . In October , net sales of stock funds at Fidelity dropped sharply , Mr. Hines said . But he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September 's level .
president.n | 3 | The dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold . Capital flight is reported to be strong . The big question is whether the new %% president %% will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills . President Jose Sarney , who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation . The unpopular Mr. Sarney , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule , is n't seeking re-election .
president.n | 1 | Yesterday , in national trading in the over-the-counter market , Gen-Probe common closed at $ 3.25 a share . Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition . `` The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors , '' said Richard Godown , %% president %% of the Industrial Biotechnology Association . He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in U.S. biotechnology companies . `` They are piggybacking onto developed technology , '' he said .
president.n | 3 | After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities . If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years . Over the past week , the %% president %% has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing . That was n't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters . Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so .
president.n | 1 | `` It 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to { take the orders } . No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks . '' Joseph Hardiman , %% president %% of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees trading on Nasdaq , agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors . But , he observes , while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down , they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher . `` Sometimes { traders } lose sight of that , '' he says .
president.n | 1 | `` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . '' BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . William O. McCoy , %% president %% of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter . Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable . For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
president.n | 3 | Wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among `` la-la activists . '' Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the %% president %% of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth .
president.n | 1 | Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization . That means Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock . Jim Unruh , Unisys 's %% president %% , said he is approaching next year with caution . He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards . He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .
president.n | 1 | In fact , managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before . However , for many , managing speed does not come naturally . `` Most of us grew up believing in the axioms ` Haste makes waste ' and ` Do n't cut corners , ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed , '' says Dean Cassell , vice %% president %% for product integrity at Grumman Corp . `` But in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off . Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers . ''
president.n | 1 | The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better . Y&R 's Klein Steps Down Arthur Klein , %% president %% of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 . In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense . `` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R , '' Mr. Kroll wrote .
president.n | 1 | Lawrence M. Gressette Jr. , %% president %% , was elected to the additional posts of chairman and chief executive officer of this utility holding company , effective Feb. 1 , 1990 . The 57-year-old Mr. Gressette , who was also elected chairman and chief executive of all Scana subsidiaries , succeeds John A. Warren . Mr. Warren will remain on the company 's board .
president.n | 1 | ( Jacksonville , Fla. ) -- Charles Bates , president , chief executive and chief operating officer will resign from these positions and the board effective Oct. 31 . Norman J. Harrison , chairman , will succeed him as chief executive . Roger L. Sutton , executive vice %% president %% , was appointed as the new president and chief operating officer . Kerry P. Charlet will become executive vice president , and retain his positions as chief financial officer and treasurer .
president.n | 1 | The rigid Ivy League customer , Brooks Brothers ' bread and butter , meanwhile is becoming extinct . Thus , Brooks Brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as Paul Stuart , Barneys New York and Louis , Boston . `` Brooks Brothers no longer has a lock on the { Ivy League } customer who is status-conscious about his clothes , '' says Charlie Davidson , %% president %% of the Andover Shop , a traditional men 's store in Cambridge , Mass . By making a break from tradition , Brooks Brothers is seeking a delicate balance . If it promotes fashion too much , the shop risks alienating its old-line customers ; by emphasizing `` value , '' it risks watering down its high-minded mystique .
president.n | 1 | Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , %% president %% of Bear Stearns Cos . Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility .
president.n | 1 | Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed , Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals . If further research proves the seed 's benefits , this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil . `` This seed 's not grown anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world , '' says T.V. Krishnamurthy , a vice %% president %% of Procter & Gamble India Ltd. , a major psyllium buyer and promoter . `` The proper climatic conditions do n't exist in many places in the world . '' Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : `` If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . ''
president.n | 1 | Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of Continental 's parent , Texas Air Corp . Mr. Lorenzo , 49 years old , is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. Corr signed on . The airline also named Mickey Foret as %% president %% . Mr. Foret , 44 , is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines , its predecessor . Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air .
president.n | 1 | Some of the more cautious CD holders might like `` pre-refunded '' municipals . These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired . `` It 's a no-brainer : You do n't have to worry about diversification ; you do n't have to worry about quality , '' says Steven J. Hueglin , executive vice %% president %% of the New York bond firm of Gabriele , Hueglin & Cashman Inc . Consider a `` laddered '' bond portfolio , with issues maturing in , say , 1992 , 1993 and 1994 , advises Malcolm A. Makin , a Westerly , R.I. , financial planner . The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates .
president.n | 1 | The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year . Revenue was C$ 291.6 million , up from C$ 252 million in 1988 . Martin Fabi , Innopac 's %% president %% and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move . `` I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , '' he said . Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .
president.n | 1 | Nissan Motor Co. expects net income to reach 120 billion yen ( U.S. $ 857 million ) in its current fiscal year , up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year , Yutaka Kume , %% president %% , said . Mr. Kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990 , ending next March 31 , in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the Tokyo Motor Show . The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations .
president.n | 1 | Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange . Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board . '' Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice %% president %% since March 1988 . He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel . By contrast , the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider , Arnold F. Staloff , as its president .
president.n | 1 | At the market price , the transaction has a total indicated value of $ 7.4 million . Kofcoh is a New York holding company for Rosalco Inc. , which imports furniture and other items . David L. Koffman , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Jayark , holds about 40 % of Kofcoh , Jayark said . Jayark , New York , distributes and rents audio-visual equipment and prints promotional ads for retailers . In the quarter ended July 31 , Jayark had an average of 5.6 million shares outstanding .
president.n | 1 | This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by Milton B. Hollander , whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford , Conn. acquired most of its 49.4 % stake in Newport in August . Elected as directors were Mr. Hollander , Frederick Ezekiel , Frederick Ross , Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier . Removed from office were George Pratt , Robert E. Davis , Norman Gray , John Virtue , corporate secretary , and Barrett B. Weekes , chairman , %% president %% and chief executive officer . Newport officials did n't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier , Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board .
president.n | 1 | The executive producer of `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' Andrew Lack , declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show , in particular . `` I do n't talk about my work , '' he says . The %% president %% of CBS News , David W. Burke , did n't return numerous telephone calls . One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a `` work in progress , '' such as the Hoffman re-creation , but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife . Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment .
president.n | 1 | The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots . In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , %% president %% of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable . Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . '' U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports .
president.n | 3 | It 's the line-item veto , a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill . Whatever one thinks of the idea , it 's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance . Rather , it 's a device that could send shock waves through the %% president %% 's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress , fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business . President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president . Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress -- which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks .
president.n | 3 | More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution . They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . '' This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the %% president %% can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . '' There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved .
president.n | 3 | `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' In addition to giving a %% president %% powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
president.n | 3 | Indeed , although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto , some , ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed . Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic %% president %% again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . ''
president.n | 1 | Through the first nine months of the year , Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds , with a 2.8 % market share , up slightly from 2.5 % in the year-earlier period , according to Securities Data Co . It 's quite a fall from the early 1980s , when Kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse . Gary S. Goldstein , %% president %% of the Whitney Group , an executive search firm , said : `` I 'd like to see ( Kidder ) succeed . But they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one . '' In 1988 , Kidder eked out a $ 46 million profit , mainly because of severe cost cutting .
president.n | 1 | But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice %% president %% of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco . `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive . Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
president.n | 1 | Meanwhile , Dallas welcomed the move . City officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name `` Everglades . '' `` When we were told it was Exxon , it was beyond all expectations ; what a coup , '' said Tom Lewis , senior vice %% president %% of Dallas Partnership , the economic development affiliate of the city 's Chamber of Commerce . Dallas , its economy based on oil and real estate , has been in a slump . Exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old Las Colinas complex in the suburb of Irving .
president.n | 3 | Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a %% president %% as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power . But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock .
president.n | 1 | At the $ 932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months . Those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds , followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August . `` The last two months have been the whole ball game , '' says Steven Norwitz , a vice %% president %% . Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices . Through Oct. 19 , high-yield funds had an average 0.85 % total return ( the price change plus dividends on fund shares ) , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc .

In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves .
president.n | 3 | Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level . Administration officials defend Mr. Bush 's decision to make the trip . While they acknowledge the %% president %% will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. Ortega , they insist that Mr. Bush wo n't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies . The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition , renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region . Officials also insist Mr. Bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries .

That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic , '' says Glenn Cox , the %% president %% of Phillips Petroleum Co . Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too . The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .
president.n | 3 | According to Mr. Nixon 's office , `` This is solely a fact-finding trip . There will be no sightseeing , no shopping and no social events . '' Mr. Nixon 's office said the former %% president %% `` expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders '' and will give his assessment of those leaders to President Bush upon his return .

president.n | 3 | As a result , the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut . Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the Packwood-Roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back , one official said . In addition , White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the %% president %% leverage in cutting deals with Democrats . A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage . Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
president.n | 1 | David Evans , who last week resigned as %% president %% and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. `` for personal reasons '' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both positions , the company said .

president.n | 1 | One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's %% president %% . There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor ( and now the governor of Texas ! ) and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees . `` You stay out of it , '' author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying .

president.n | 3 | Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools . As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class woman , Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ? Or that the %% president %% would have hurried to sign the bill `` out of compassion for her plight '' ? To ask those questions is to answer them . Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government .
president.n | 1 | Earlier this year , the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $ 25 million . Lawrence Perlman , Control Data 's president and chief operating officer , said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's `` strategy to be a data solutions company . '' Thomas Vassiliades , %% president %% of Bell Atlantic 's customer services division , said the acquisition would give the company 's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in `` the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies .
president.n | 3 | ( During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . ) TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving . That Labor Day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as %% president %% , Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act . Pension reform was its main thrust . Labor and business leaders , quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .

president.n | 3 | And the vacillation did n't end there . Just a month ago , Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life . Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the %% president %% said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest . But only four days after that , Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat . `` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
president.n | 3 | Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion . Mr. Bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it . The political risk would be far less if the %% president %% drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist . `` If you have a position , you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much , '' says Republican strategist John Sears . The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush , who , Mr. Sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological base .
president.n | 3 | His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office , affirming his `` firm support of our cause '' during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January . He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion . But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July , the %% president %% began to lower the volume . When the ruling was handed down , the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself . He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .

president.n | 3 | The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings , mostly with Senate Democrats , to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut . The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax . According to some who attended , the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the %% president %% to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending . The president was said to have been noncommittal .
president.n | 1 | The potential bill : more than $ 600 million for several seasons , an 80 % jump . A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports %% president %% now at Multimedia Inc . J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' And the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
president.n | 1 | They gleefully await the `` dream season '' in 1990 . CBS will air the Super Bowl , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events . `` It 's made me more committed to CBS , '' says Philip A. Jones , the %% president %% of Meredith Corp. 's broadcast group , which has two CBS affiliates . The CBS plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however . No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak .
president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 1 | Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars . Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive Cima , Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand . `` One dealer told me that if he had more cars , he 'd sell them right away , '' says Takuro Endo , Nissan executive vice %% president %% . He adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand `` by overworking '' its employees . Similarly , Honda Motor Co.

president.n | 3 | The 231-191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces . It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush . Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin , but Republicans were equally firm in support of the %% president %% , who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills . Yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills , an estimated $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor , Education , and Health and Human Services . To gain more leverage , abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month .
president.n | 3 | The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote . By comparison , Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement . Only 42 GOP members opposed the %% president %% 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year . At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte ( R. , Mass. ) , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position . `` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said Rep. Henry Hyde ( R. , Ill. ) , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement .

president.n | 1 | Orders from Campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration . This is no longer true because of Campeau 's massive debt load . `` It 's all anybody wants to talk about , '' says Richard Posner , executive vice %% president %% for Credit Exchange Inc. , a leading credit service . `` People wonder what 's going to happen next . '' Many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to Campeau stores .
president.n | 1 | Not only does your product have to be excellent , but you also have to be able to collect . '' Other manufacturers are equally cautious . Bud Konheim , %% president %% of Nicole Miller Inc. , says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains . This limits his financial exposure , he says . `` The branches are just warmed over , empty halls , '' says Mr. Konheim .
president.n | 1 | Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year . Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly . Erich Krampe , %% president %% of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes . Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share . Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .
president.n | 1 | Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $ 25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $ 187 million shortly , Richard Miller , %% president %% , said at the annual meeting .

president.n | 1 | Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 . Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , %% president %% . One state environmental regulator returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. Maguire says . WITHHOLDING RULES :
president.n | 1 | A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature . But observers expect broad support . `` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said Kirk West , %% president %% of the California Chamber of Commerce . But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief tab . Since the late 1970s , California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13 .
president.n | 1 | In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Cray closed down $ 1.125 at $ 34.25 .

Marcello Gumucio , %% president %% , said the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing orders . '' As for the current period , Mr. Gumucio said , `` We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when Cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share . He added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . ''

president.n | 1 | Shearson , meanwhile , posted net income of $ 106 million for the first nine months of the year , down slightly from $ 110 million for the year-ago period . Moody 's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary , to single-A-1 from double-A-3 , citing problems in the company 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . '' John Kriz , a Moody 's vice %% president %% , said Boston Safe Deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities . The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said . Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality .

Stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price .

Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as %% president %% was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising . Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc . Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker .
president.n | 1 | Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha , Neb. , and has 24 factory outlets , with plans to add more . Before joining Maidenform in 1972 , Mr. Brawer , who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago , taught at the University of Wisconsin . As a senior vice %% president %% , he has headed the company 's designer lingerie division , Oscar de la Renta , since its inception in 1988 . To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the Maidenform name . While the company has always been family-run , Mr. Brawer is n't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform .
president.n | 1 | If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines .

But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S. .
president.n | 1 | Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency . Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .

president.n | 1 | `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .

Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .

president.n | 1 | The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air . One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors . Glenn Cox , Phillips ' %% president %% and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 .

president.n | 1 | Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen %% president %% . Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman . Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand . When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors . `` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , %% president %% of Daiwa 's U.S. unit . `` But not a single piece of paper was sold . '' By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
president.n | 1 | David Baltimore , who has just been named %% president %% of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to go through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name . The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .
president.n | 1 | During the third quarter , it said , it won several significant contracts , including a five-year contract with the National Institutes of Health valued at an estimated $ 8 million . Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems . The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , %% president %% and chief executive . Convex also recently agreed to use Posix , a standard for the computer language called UNIX . Posix is one of three or four versions of UNIX , but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems .

president.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice %% president %% , said the action `` wo n't really have any effect on us . We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . '' The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
president.n | 1 | Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . '' If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is Poland . Jessica Mathews , vice %% president %% of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. , says that perhaps a quarter of Poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution . The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages . The future of the forest remains uncertain .
president.n | 1 | Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th . Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week . `` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice %% president %% at T. Rowe Price Associates . `` People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . '' Source : Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
president.n | 1 | Qintex Australia Ltd. encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its %% president %% and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned . Neither could be reached for comment . Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire MGM\/UA Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction .
president.n | 3 | `` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request . `` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said . The %% president %% 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts . Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
president.n | 3 | The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank . `` The problem with this administration , I think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the NSC . '' The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the %% president %% and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies . By law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense . In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
president.n | 1 | CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 . The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs , said Jay R. Cohen , Champs executive vice %% president %% . CRI , which sponsors Champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm .

president.n | 1 | Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable . '' ( Investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent . ) Richard Luehrs , %% president %% of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce , calls boiler rooms a `` negative we wish we could get rid of . '' Actually , `` we do n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists , `` except for the press who write about it . '' Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau .
president.n | 1 | Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . Alan D'Agosto , %% president %% of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
president.n | 1 | The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts . The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 . `` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' said Peter R. Kann , %% president %% of Dow Jones . `` We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs . Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers . ''
president.n | 1 | Inmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share . Sales rose 12 % to $ 249.5 million from $ 222.8 million . `` The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results , '' said Kenneth A. Eldred , %% president %% and chief executive officer . `` All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development , continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend , '' he added . The company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Conway , 42 years old , was elected chairman , president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . Harry Rossi , 69 , chairman of the holding company , also remains chairman of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . Mr. Conway was executive vice %% president %% and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co. , of Cincinnati , in 1987 , when Union Central bought a 54 % interest in Manhattan National Corp . He resigned as an officer of Central Life to accept the Manhattan National presidency .
president.n | 1 | Gerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company . He succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant . Mr. Wood has been %% president %% and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc .
president.n | 1 | Terry L. Haines , formerly general manager of Canadian operations , was elected to the new position of vice %% president %% , North American sales , of this plastics concern . Also , Larry A. Kushkin , executive vice president , North American operations , was named head of the company 's international automotive operations , another new position . He remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . ''
president.n | 1 | Polymerix makes lumber-like materials that it describes as `` plastic wood . '' The operating chief 's post is new . Martin Schrager , 51 , who had been %% president %% , was named vice chairman . He remains chief executive officer . Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp .
president.n | 1 | Falconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form . `` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's %% president %% says . Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . `` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says .
president.n | 3 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the %% president %% complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
president.n | 3 | In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives . Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % . As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for %% president %% than in those for Congress . In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress . Prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite .
president.n | 3 | The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes . While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as %% president %% and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
president.n | 1 | For those who do n't need their personalized information moment by moment , some services are offering overnight newsletters . Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day . `` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and %% president %% . The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a base cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service . One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
president.n | 1 | The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico . Rafael Carrion Jr. , chairman of Banco Popular , will be the chairman of the holding company . Alberto M. Paracchini , currently chairman of BanPonce , will serve as %% president %% of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary . Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million . BanPonce reacted cooly at first , but appeared to be won over , analysts said , by Banco Popular 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .
president.n | 1 | Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture last month , named Premier Advertiser Sales , to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies , such as `` Star Trek : the Next Generation , '' `` Charles in Charge '' and `` Friday the 13th : the Series . '' A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company does n't comment on speculation . Calls to Shelly Schwab , %% president %% of MCA TV , were n't returned . The two companies , like Fox , already have their own TV stations . MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79 % stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $ 140 million .
president.n | 1 | The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers . American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling . Susumu Ohara , %% president %% of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine . `` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said Thomas Kenney , a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group . `` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
president.n | 1 | Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage . That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage . `` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now %% president %% of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md . It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs . The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group .
president.n | 1 | That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice %% president %% of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
president.n | 3 | He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect . But Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed . Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the %% president %% 's initiative would fail this year . Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
president.n | 1 | Because he sees a `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon . Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills . Greg Confair , %% president %% of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . `` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says .
president.n | 1 | The $ 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 . The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds . Individual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice %% president %% and chief economist of the Institute . `` Insitutional investors , on the other hand , reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday , '' Mr. Dreyer said . Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter .
president.n | 1 | `` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . J. Thomas Allen , %% president %% of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says . But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
president.n | 3 | The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical . The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government . The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the %% president %% . But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed . Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
president.n | 1 | Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said . Dr. Grossman , who also is %% president %% of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements . The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review . `` Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded .
president.n | 1 | CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty . A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry 's 10 biggest challenges . `` If it causes management to take their eye off the ball , inventory shrinkage is going to be affected , '' says Lewis Shealy , vice %% president %% for loss prevention at Marshall Field 's , the department store chain . A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss . Co-author Richard Hollinger cites what happened at one family-owned company absorbed by a foreign giant .
president.n | 1 | Robert A. Oswald , chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company , was elected to the additional position of executive vice %% president %% . In addition , Michael W. O'Donnell , executive vice president of a Columbia unit , was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company . The appointments take effect Nov. 1 .
president.n | 1 | Now , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some advisers say it 's time for investors to take a hard , cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning . `` The market is sending nervous signals , '' says Peter J. Canelo , chief market strategist for Bear , Stearns & Co. , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks . Alan Weston , %% president %% of Weston Capital Management , a Los Angeles money-management firm , adds that in periods of uncertainty like today , `` it 's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio . '' Not everybody agrees that it 's time to trim . `` We are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now , '' says Steven G. Einhorn , chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman , Sachs & Co .
president.n | 1 | He concedes H&R Block is `` well-entrenched '' and `` a great company , '' but says `` it does n't grow fast enough for us . We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable { price-earnings } multiple . '' Thomas M. Bloch , %% president %% and chief operating officer , says `` I would disagree '' that the tax business is mature . For example , he says , the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service , tested in parts of the country , aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry . Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through .
president.n | 1 | Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks , audio disk players , videodisks and videodisk players . It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices . James N. Fiedler , %% president %% of Discovision and a vice president of MCA , said that IBM and MCA had n't planned to sell the joint venture , which is now profitable , but that Pioneer approached Discovision earlier this year . He said it is n't certain whether Discovision 's current management will remain when Pioneer buys the company . The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed later this year .
president.n | 1 | Because of the size of the California market , few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath . But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state . `` What you 're going to get is ` We do n't want to put all of our eggs in one basket ' theory , '' said James H. Renzas , %% president %% of Location Management Services Inc. , a Palo Alto , Calif. , relocation concern . Mr. Renzas , among others , said the quake will prod companies in certain industries , like semiconductors , computers and aerospace , to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California . Because of the quake threat , `` some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere , '' he said .
president.n | 1 | As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments . `` In terms of coverage , it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes , '' said Eric Premner , %% president %% for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co. , which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle , Wash . While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake . `` I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster , '' said Mr. Premner .
president.n | 1 | But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup . But `` Friday did n't help things , '' says Mr. Schaefer . With the gyrations of recent days , says Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice %% president %% at Charles Schwab , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . '' Joseph Grano , president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market . Investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says .
president.n | 1 | Marketers themselves are partly to blame : They 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising . What 's more , a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands , many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other . `` Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use '' of promotions , contends Joe Plummer , an executive vice %% president %% at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency . `` Without some real product improvements , it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back . '' The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use .
president.n | 1 | `` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . '' Campbell Soup Co. , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands . `` The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 , '' says Tony Adams , the company 's vice %% president %% for marketing research . `` The best odds are with your core franchise . Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''

president.n | 1 | The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible . The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years . `` You see these in just about every LBO , '' said Robert Willens , senior vice %% president %% in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York . `` It becomes a source of cash '' for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years . Typically , Mr. Willens estimates , this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs .
president.n | 1 | IBM 's traditional mainframe rivals , including Unisys Corp. , Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp. , have struggled recently . Digital is promising a new approach . Robert M. Glorioso , Digital 's vice %% president %% for high performance systems , says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices . And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes , it does n't need any plumbing . The challengers will have a big price advantage .
president.n | 1 | Michael F. Klatman , director of corporate public relations at Data General Corp. , was named to the new position of vice %% president %% , corporate communications , of this maker of data storage equipment .
president.n | 1 | Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill . Like thousands of salespeople before them , Wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news . `` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said Richard Miller , the Lowell , Mass. , computer concern 's new %% president %% , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over . Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts . Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers .
president.n | 1 | `` When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with Wang . '' For Mr. Tait , who says he used to earn as much as $ 150,000 a year at Wang , it was one more reason to quit . He is now %% president %% of Eastate Homes Inc. , an Indianapolis contractor . It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement . Brian Petre , a former Wang salesman in upstate New York , says : `` You have pride in your job .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985 , and before that was president of Public Strategies , a Washington consulting firm .

president.n | 1 | Three of the utility 's directors have at least doubled their holdings in the company since July . The largest purchase was by Dudley Taft , who bought 4,400 shares for $ 125,075 . Mr. Taft , who is also %% president %% of Taft Broadcasting Co. , said he bought the shares because he keeps a utility account at the brokerage firm of Salomon Brothers Inc. , which had recommended the stock as a good buy . Salomon Brothers confirmed that it has had a buy recommendation on the stock for about two years . `` Cincinnati Gas & Electric is in good shape , '' Mr. Taft said , and utilities are `` a good investment because interest rates are going down . ''
president.n | 1 | In the end , Teddy returns alone to America , leaving Ruth in Max 's chair . We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother , and then some . While Steppenwolf was in London with `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' Bruce Sagan , the %% president %% of its board of directors , quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city 's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district .

president.n | 1 | Charles S. Mitchell , a vice %% president %% with Homart Development Co. , the real estate development subsidiary of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , was named president of Figgie Properties , a real estate development unit .

president.n | 1 | United Merchants & Manufacturers Inc. said its %% president %% , Uzi Ruskin , withdrew his proposal to acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company . Last month , Mr. Ruskin proposed , among other things , to buy 3.5 million shares , or 38 % , for $ 4 apiece . Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4 % held by an associate , the stake would have given him control of 55 % of the concern .
president.n | 1 | `` Ford 's appetite to attack { Jaguar } could gradually wane over time , particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition , '' says John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute . He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months . Clifford Stahl , %% president %% and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc. , two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm 's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each , making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\/8 in early May . `` I thought the probabilities of { a bidding war } happening were less , '' he says . Of course , that was before Ford 's latest move .
president.n | 3 | President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor , Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest , the White House said . Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously . But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the %% president %% . White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success . Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto .
president.n | 1 | `` October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand ... among people leaving the stock market . '' Some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about CDs since Friday . `` Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so , '' said Steven Braitman , a vice %% president %% at Chemical Bank in New York . Chemical said deposits Monday were about $ 5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock . `` This is no time to be playing in the street ...
president.n | 1 | Hans Stoll , finance professor at Vanderbilt University , says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced . `` I just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , '' he says . And Robert D. Arnott , %% president %% of asset allocator First Quadrant , notes that before Friday 's tailspin , daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached `` historically low levels . '' Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower . John J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the Big Board , asserts that `` 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years . ''

president.n | 1 | Still , proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev . In fact , because communism seems to be beating a global retreat , some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs . `` The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , '' says Mitchell Daniels , a former Reagan White House aide who now is %% president %% of the Hudson Institute . Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes . But they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide .
president.n | 1 | But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning , dashed those expectations . Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt . `` Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said Roger Early , a vice %% president %% at Federated Investors Inc. , Pittsburgh . `` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . '' Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations .
president.n | 3 | But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next , Starr adds . HUGO 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds . This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the %% president %% as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters . It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until April 16 to choose . Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher Prentice Hall .
president.n | 1 | Michael A. Gaskin , 55 years old , was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots , succeeding Walter K. Weisel . Mr. Weisel , 49 , resigned as %% president %% and chief executive and will work on special projects , said John J. Wallace , chairman .

president.n | 1 | For instance , Ken Gregory , a San Francisco money manager , calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year . `` If you do n't need the money for 10 years , there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. Gregory says . Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns , says John Blankenship Jr. , %% president %% of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners . Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says . There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say .

president.n | 1 | `` It was their business decision , '' the official said . Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC %% president %% and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant . But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million , the Amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from Mr. Fossett 's own assets .
president.n | 1 | But he said IBM would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer . He said IBM has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases . Bob Bardagy , executive vice %% president %% of marketing at Comdisco Inc. , a huge leasing firm , said : `` To put it mildly , IBM Credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen . '' IBM is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes . But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which means it is long in the tooth , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own .
president.n | 1 | Debt-free and profitable , the Boulder , Colo. , computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO now , he says . KnowledgeWare Inc. , an Atlanta computer-software concern , says it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change . `` It 's a wait-and-see situation right now , '' says Terry McGowan , %% president %% . Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies . Sierra Tucson Cos. , a Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week .
president.n | 1 | Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently . Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds . Alan Wells , %% president %% of Bollinger , Wells , Lett & Co. , a New York merger specialist , thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals . Instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he says . And William E. Wetzel Jr. , a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc. , says the market 's gyrations will underline the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments .
president.n | 1 | Expo enthusiasts argue that holding the fair would attract businesses , create jobs and help renovate abandoned sections of town . But opponents fear overcrowding . `` This city already has too many tourists , and it ca n't hold them all , '' says Pierluigi Beggiato , the %% president %% of the Venice hoteliers association . About 40 Italian businesses , including Fiat S.p . A. and Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. , have formed a consortium to lobby for holding the expo in Venice . Three gambling casinos have opened in Poland .

president.n | 1 | Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco .

Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money .

president.n | 1 | Both were right . Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it has n't sold well . To date , says Emil Jachmann , a Dictaphone vice %% president %% , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . '' Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways . It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products .

If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers . Diane Seaman , an NBC-TV vice %% president %% , says NBC has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time . She would n't say what the premium is , but it 's believed to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates . `` We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , '' says Ms. Seaman .

While the Kremlin has urged a ban on output of the poison gases , the White House wants to continue %% producing %% the weapons even after an international treaty calling for their destruction is signed .

About 70,000 people attended the anti-government rally , at which leaders of the banned African National Congress refused to renounce violence to end apartheid .
produce.v | 2 | Currently , there is a lull in the psyllium war . The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe . It also ordered P&G to %% produce %% more studies to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol . But the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves . If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium , other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products .
produce.v | 2 | NBC 's re-creations are produced by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions , which also makes the successful prime-time NBC Entertainment series `` Unsolved Mysteries . '' The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless . News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to %% produce %% than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program . Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that . Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` A Current Affair , '' which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
produce.v | 1 | In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves . Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil . Until the tanker spill , Big Oil was slowly convincing authorities it could safely %% produce %% from such places . Now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry , possibly for years . Similarly , a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the California coast in the early 1980s .
produce.v | 1 | According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , `` Batibot '' does n't set out to advance the cause of Filipino . `` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it .

produce.v | 1 | IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses . The project involving Motorola concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips . Currently , chips are produced by shining light through a mask to %% produce %% an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film . But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one . X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
produce.v | 1 | Boeing Co. said Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $ 450 million . The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly %% produced %% by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France . Currently , Boeing has a backlog of about $ 80 billion , but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists , which entered its 22nd day today . Last week , a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers , who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10 % over three years .
produce.v | 1 | The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made . They use 60 % more fertilizer per acre , twice the high-grade feed . Yet their best boast is that they %% produce %% 32 % of Polish pork . `` I 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized , '' Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife , Wieslawa , sets some chairs out in the sun . `` We have one near here .
produce.v | 1 | Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , %% producing %% a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
produce.v | 1 | Raw-steel production by the nation 's mills decreased 0.7 % last week to 1,816,000 tons from 1,828,000 tons the previous week , the American Iron and Steel Institute said .

produce.v | 1 | In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery . Petroleum products prices also declined . Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is %% producing %% substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day . That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further .
produce.v | 2 | Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' %% produced %% by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
produce.v | 1 | But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled . Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year . For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. %% produced %% a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and -0.06 % in the third quarter . Total return is price changes plus interest income . Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .
produce.v | 1 | However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member . Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system . `` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can %% produce %% at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi . At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling . They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
produce.v | 1 | But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East . Inspired by imports , Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings . This year he %% produced %% a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green . He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars . From Asia , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs .
produce.v | 1 | Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market ( Figure 6 ) , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has %% produced %% an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .
produce.v | 1 | Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes . Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to %% produce %% electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say . Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say .
produce.v | 1 | As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely . One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota . Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to %% produce %% results . But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . `` The results were fascinating , '' he said .
produce.v | 1 | Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be %% producing %% the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements . Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
produce.v | 1 | In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can %% produce %% previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
produce.v | 2 | Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI , but before it can , a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter , the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency . The lowly agent , Abel Lamb , who as you might guess , is being led to the slaughter , is ordered to take over the studio . Soon the studio is %% producing %% a $ 40 million picture called `` Tet , the Motion Picture , '' to distinguish it from `` Tet , the Offensive , '' as well as `` Tet , the Book '' and `` Tet , the Album . '' The picture , to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador , is a cover for sending $ 800 million of arms to Los Otros , the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua , which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega , a former podiatrist , who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers . The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle , Mr. Gelbart 's stand in for Col. Oliver North .
produce.v | 1 | These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott . There is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being %% produced %% around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .
produce.v | 1 | `` My mother read a book right after I was born and there was a Lilian in the book she loved and I became Lilian -- and eventually I became Paula '' . Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student . This family of Luxemburg immigrants , in fact , %% produced %% two exceptional children . Paula 's older brother is Edward Steichen , a talented artist and , for the past half-century , one of the world 's eminent photographers . ( Two years ago the photography editor of Vogue Magazine titled his article about Steichen , `` The World 's Greatest Photographer '' . )
produce.v | 1 | The Leopard 's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it %% produced %% good results ? ? In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked . The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .
produce.v | 1 | In the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin . There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong . Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not %% produce %% the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900 . Now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .
produce.v | 1 | One beat poet composes a poem , `` Lines On A Tijuana John '' , which contains a few happy hints for survival . The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity . The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they %% produce %% is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation . Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ? Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .

As she worked she absentmindedly crooned , %% producing %% a curious sound . Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths . Helva 's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings .
promise.v | 1 | CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience %% promised %% to advertisers . CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .
promise.v | 1 | Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast %% promised %% the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years . Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies . Wilbur Ross , financial adviser to the equity holders said , `` Given the state 's strong bargaining position ... we believe the NU plan provides the best recovery available '' to PS of New Hampshire 's equity holders .

On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush %% promised %% to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts . California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans . The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .

( Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake , but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips . ) Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean %% promise %% money-back guarantees . In Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $ 35 , or as much as 22 % below regular prices . Says Michele Hoffman , a clerk in the resort 's front office : `` We do n't have the outdoor pool , the pool table , ping pong table , snack bar or VCR , but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi .

'' The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which %% promised %% investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .

But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he %% promised %% us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf . ( But who 's counting . ) Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah .

promise.v | 1 | Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space . But Keith looked down more than up . He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he %% promised %% himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords . At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war . But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .
promise.v | 1 | Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway . Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago . Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had %% promised %% she could have when he died . I 'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . This letter would have got to me if she had n't even put Rome , Italy , on it .

Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Wo n't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil 's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia . I %% promised %% to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice . Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie 's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda 's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles .

Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be %% proposed %% . Still , some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom .
propose.v | 1 | The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds .

propose.v | 1 | A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's %% proposed %% state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state . New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused . The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license .

propose.v | 1 | Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million . Some of the %% proposed %% modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels . Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions .
propose.v | 1 | BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related move , the bank also %% proposed %% that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals . BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .
propose.v | 2 | It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting . Wilson , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust . He had preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he %% proposed %% to do here . He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor . But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose .
prove.v | 1 | He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other . The tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged . But there was no way to %% prove %% Dr. Knudson 's `` two-hit '' theory . Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .
prove.v | 1 | Do n't Linger `` The best thing you can do is get off the screen , '' says Mr. Buchwald . Nobody %% proved %% that more masterfully than Mr. Coelho , the former Democratic majority whip . Declaring that there was life after Congress , he resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a 1986 junk-bond investment , before any official investigations took hold . Among the glitterati who turned out in bipartisan black-tie force to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were Sen. Robert Dole , Rep. Newt Gingrich , and other kingpins of Congress .
prove.v | 2 | Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day . Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar . They added that the DJIA 's swift drop %% proved %% an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed . In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8355 marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen late Monday . Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6055 , up from $ 1.6030 late Monday .
prove.v | 2 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family %% proved %% profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
prove.v | 2 | Elected to Congress in 1978 , the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan . Like many of his colleagues , he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors . Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences , and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials %% proved %% useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor , Thomas Kean , in the 1981 Republican primary here . The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean . While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
prove.v | 1 | But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been %% proved %% inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .
prove.v | 2 | Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather . His rage assumes a religious form ; ; that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . This passion brings on a fit which %% proves %% fatal . Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away . This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .
prove.v | 1 | He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably . He treats it with a mythological , universal application . As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be %% proven %% by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families . Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil . Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
prove.v | 2 | I could n't face Thelma after that night . I did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone . I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had %% proved %% too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express . Of course I had to give her Eileen 's address , but she never came near us . All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .
prove.v | 1 | A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball . There will be romance and flirtation . If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could %% prove %% to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
prove.v | 1 | `` Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent '' . `` I know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said . `` You 're working up to something , and if you do n't watch out you 'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to %% prove %% that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression '' . `` The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said . They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .
prove.v | 2 | He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing %% proved %% to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men 's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
prove.v | 1 | I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to %% prove %% not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand . I made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen .
purchase.v | 1 | Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices . `` Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there is n't enough grain in the pipeline , '' said Katharina Zimmer , a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York . The Soviet Union has %% purchased %% roughly eight million tons of grain this month , and is expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said . COTTON : Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy .
purchase.v | 1 | Brush Wellman Inc. said its board increased the number of shares of common stock to be %% purchased %% under a previously authorized program to 3.9 million from 2.9 million . The maker of engineered materials has acquired more than 2.7 million shares under the program .
purchase.v | 1 | The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York . Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale . The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD %% purchased %% in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
purchase.v | 1 | However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline . He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the ( quarterly ) refunding '' of government debt to be held next month by the Treasury . A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese %% purchased %% no more than 10 % of the two-year notes . Treasury , Agency Securities Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp .
purchase.v | 1 | First Executive Corp. said about 96 % of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised . Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said . Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also %% purchase %% an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units . First Executive said the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business . In addition , analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding .
purchase.v | 1 | Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 . The New Jersey paper , like the New Haven , Conn. , paper , was %% purchased %% by Ingersoll on Goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract . Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances . Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers .
purchase.v | 1 | One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to %% purchase %% the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
purchase.v | 1 | Nestle currently has only about a 2 % share with its Taster 's Choice coffee . Poland plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from Iran , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported . The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland 's willingess to %% purchase %% the gas during Mr. Vaezi 's current visit to Warsaw . The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered . A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong .
raise.v | 1 | Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic carriers , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 . Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary . Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange %% raised %% the required margin on stock-margin transactions . China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony . The two , Szeto Wah and Martin Lee , were deemed unfit because they had condemned China 's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement .
raise.v | 6 | Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much . And they continue anonymously attacking CIA Director William Webster for being too accommodating to the committee . At the same time , some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. Boren and Cohen of wimping out , and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions %% raise %% the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales . But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky Congress will balk .
raise.v | 1 | Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years . The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead . A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth 's polar ice caps , %% raising %% the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas . `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
raise.v | 4 | Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official says . Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back . Although `` it 's still difficult to %% raise %% money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . '' Wall Street generally likes the industry again . The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit yesterday when Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its short-term investment ratings on them .
raise.v | 6 | The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we %% raised %% what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) . He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
raise.v | 1 | Amgen advanced 1 1\/2 to 56 ; Chiron jumped 2 to 29 3\/4 ; Cetus gained 1 to 16 7\/8 and Biogen rose 5\/8 to 14 5\/8 . The American depositary receipts of Jaguar jumped 3\/8 to 11 5\/8 on turnover of 1.9 million . Ford Motor said it %% raised %% its stake in the British car maker to 12.45 % of the ordinary shares outstanding . In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Ford said it holds 22.8 million ordinary shares . The company has said it is prepared to make a bid for all of the shares outstanding of Jaguar if British government restrictions to such a transaction are removed .
raise.v | 1 | But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations . The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further %% raises %% the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months .
raise.v | 6 | Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to GE . GE 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity . The company 's conduct `` does not even %% raise %% a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts . `` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters . '' Mr. Orr could n't be reached for comment yesterday .
raise.v | 4 | The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to %% raise %% funds in a hurry . According to the state department of finance , a one-penny increase in the state 's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $ 3 billion . Willie Brown , speaker of California 's Assembly , said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks .
raise.v | 1 | Since the late 1970s , California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13 . The state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply %% raising %% gasoline taxes on a permanent basis . To raise more highway funds , a measure to double the state 's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years is set to appear on the state 's June election ballot . But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure .
raise.v | 1 | Northeast Utilities %% raised %% its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value claimed by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid .
raise.v | 1 | DISASTER STATES are n't jumping to %% raise %% taxes for relief and recovery . Not yet , anyway . Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes .
raise.v | 1 | but worries about 1990 . With most legislatures adjourned for the year , small business is tallying its scorecard . Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from %% raising %% state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans . While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes Don L. Robinson , associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business organization . Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated .
raise.v | 1 | Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads . The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . The 1987 highway bill permitted states to %% raise %% the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates . `` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors { primarily to greater speed } , '' according to NHTSA .
raise.v | 1 | The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) . The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats . They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart %% raises %% and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal . They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow . The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
raise.v | 1 | `` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says . So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 ) . A severe recession could , of course , %% raise %% delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat . In fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly . In July , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987 .
raise.v | 4 | `` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes . Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout . Mr. Keating %% raised %% $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering . He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
raise.v | 6 | Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts . American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for %% raising %% `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants . The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 . JURY 'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first .
raise.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it %% raised %% its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
raise.v | 2 | About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants . It also %% raised %% hackles of the city 's tourism boosters . `` Other cities are calling { groups booked here for tours and conferences } and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos . City officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city .
raise.v | 6 | `` The market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said Bernard B. Beal , chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market . Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election . Now , there have been a number of questions %% raised %% . '' Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point . New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday .
raise.v | 1 | Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he %% raised %% base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week . It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
raise.v | 1 | `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by %% raising %% or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
raise.v | 1 | Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . Air-freight carriers %% raised %% their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years . Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan .
raise.v | 6 | Nor is it a Hungary , where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy . Still , any change in East Germany has enormous implications , for both East and West . It %% raises %% the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow , Washington and Western Europe . Mr. Krenz , 52 , was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin . Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday .
raise.v | 7 | But , just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help . Respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region . Here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to %% raise %% their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty . I can not express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans . Through the World Bank and other instrumentalities , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must squarely face this titanic challenge .
raise.v | 2 | They felt rough and kind and warm . At this moment the volley-ball hit the ground . Duclos ran toward Desprez with fists %% raised %% . The guards all rushed up to intervene '' Shedding his prison cloak , Helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a Flemish worker . Riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across Germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached Vichy France , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in Virginia .
raise.v | 6 | He gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running : as in the Battle of the Bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the American newspapers . Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences . In this case others should not have had to %% raise %% the doubts and fears . The Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent . It is of the utmost importance to the people of America and of the world how their governing President `` ends up '' during the four years of his term .
raise.v | 2 | They ran for three hours . Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall . For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , %% raising %% their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering . Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady . They were studying the ground .
raise.v | 2 | There 's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family . Procreation , expansion , proliferation -- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion . When the fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her %% raised %% trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted . And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth . She was the last living of the older generation .
raise.v | 2 | Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he %% raised %% his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as usual , loved it .

raise.v | 2 | On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash . `` Aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! ! The Indian was again %% raising %% his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson 's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian 's lips . Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle .
raise.v | 2 | `` I am . If you 've got any ideas '' . He %% raised %% the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson 's chest . `` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said . She seemed irritated .
raise.v | 2 | He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to %% raise %% the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .
raise.v | 2 | He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles . His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high . With his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes %% raised %% and fixed straight ahead . He had a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot . I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
raise.v | 2 | `` There 's something here '' ! ! Said the digger . Joking stopped and everyone gathered around . The digger , thrusting about with his shovel , now %% raised %% into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer 's Hollywood sport shirts . Although it was a mere fragment of the victim 's remains , it was enough . Welch was wild with delight .
rate.n | 1 | The group also seeks uniformity among states in provisions for taxpayers ' rights . This week , New York City announced a 10-point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers . THE MILEAGE RATE allowed for business use of a car in 1989 has risen to 25.5 cents a mile for the first 15,000 from 24 cents in 1988 , the IRS says ; the %% rate %% stays 11 cents for each added mile . Also unaltered : 12 cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs . IRA BALANCES could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by Reps. Chandler ( R. , Wash . ) and Andrews ( D. , Texas ) .
rate.n | 1 | `` Last year , there were only several big investors who were interested , '' says Kinji Kato , a vice president at the international arm of Nomura Securities Co . `` This year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot . '' Ultimately , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest %% rates %% on mortgage securities . At the moment , Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments . But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the 59-dealer selling group .
rate.n | 1 | The securities yield from 9.35 % to 10.48 % for a 30-year issue with an average life of 21.18 years . The 10.48 % yield represents a spread to the 20-year Treasury of 2.45 percentage points . The collateral consists of collateralized whole loans with a weighted average coupon %% rate %% of 11.08 % and weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28 years . The issue is rated triple-A by S&P , Moody 's and Fitch Investors Service Inc . The issue is 6 % to 7 % overcollateralized , and 75 % of the loans are covered by a General Electric pool policy covering losses of as much as 10 % of the original principal balance of the loans .
rate.n | 1 | The average interest %% rate %% rose to 8.3875 % at Citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper , or corporate IOUs , from 8.337 % at last week 's sale . Bids totaling $ 515 million were submitted . Accepted bids ranged from 8.38 % to 8.395 % .
rate.n | 1 | In another report yesterday , the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14 % in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August . The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South , where Hurricane Hugo was a factor . Although September 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage %% rates %% earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market . The September drop was the largest since a 19 % drop in January 1982 , but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators . Because the figures are based on a small sample , the department said it is 90 % confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5 % and 23 % during the month .
rate.n | 2 | By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing . Coke has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country . That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption %% rate %% -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. . And combining Fraser & Neave 's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there , Coke said .
rate.n | 1 | The average three-month issue rose to 8.05 % from 7.77 % . Typically , banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills , which are considered the safest short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products . But when market interest %% rates %% move up rapidly , increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag . Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs , those with denominations over $ 90,000 , also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields . The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 % , Banxquote said .

Investors , who took profits Friday , mostly took a wait-and-see attitude Monday amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and New York stocks , traders said . Takamori Matsuda , an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities , said fading expectation for lower interest %% rates %% made investors step back from real-estate shares , which advanced last week .

His comments were interpreted as a sign that higher interest rates are possible .

rate.n | 1 | David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy . Robert White , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3\/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13\/16 % . Fed funds is the %% rate %% banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system . Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future .

rate.n | 1 | Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point . Several other European central banks , notably in Britain , followed the West German Bundesbank 's lead by raising their own key rates . And a week later , Japan raised its official discount %% rate %% by a half point to 3.75 % . The Japanese discount rate is the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks . After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3\/4 % .

G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy .

Jens-Uwe Fischer , a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt , said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data , particularly U.S. trade figures , level off . He contended that the Fed wo n't ease rates further , but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key %% rates %% in West Germany . Alfred Zapfel , chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt , took an opposite stance . He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November .
rate.n | 1 | Mr. Salinas 's unpopular Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , faces congressional elections in 1991 . For the PRI to stand a chance , Mr. Salinas has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth . But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange %% rate %% and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange . Mr. Salinas needs big investment inflows -- quickly . The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on Mr. Salinas .
rate.n | 1 | At the same time , a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago . Comments by John Major , who has succeeded Mr. Lawson , also failed to damp market concern , despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates . According to one London-based analyst , even higher interest %% rates %% wo n't help the pound if Britain 's government continues to appear unstable . One U.S. trader , however , dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit . `` There is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should , '' he said .
rate.n | 1 | The $ 500 million in notes , the largest chunk of Western Union 's $ 640 million in long-term debt , stems from the company 's major restructuring in December 1987 . The notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to 19.25 % last June . Western Union had offered to swap each $ 1,000 face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues : a $ 500 note paying an interest %% rate %% starting at 16.75 % annually and rising in later years , due in 1992 , and a $ 500 note , due in 1997 , paying a fixed rate of 17 % and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond . Western Union must make $ 48 million in interest payments on the reset notes on Dec. 15 , and a company spokesman said it fully intends to meet the payments . But Western Union has said it must lower the interest rate on its debt to regain full financial health .

rate.n | 1 | `` And where we are is bad . '' Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year . That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the %% rate %% down sharply in August and September . Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .
rate.n | 1 | The flat report followed a four-month string of declines . The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan in May . The central bank also unexpectedly raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 3.75 % Oct. 11 as part of an inflation-fighting move that indirectly increases interest %% rates %% charged on new home construction loans .
rate.n | 1 | As expected , the longer-term tax-exempt New York bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term Treasury bonds . The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92 % . Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt New York City bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of Treasury %% rates %% , for any New York City issue in recent memory . A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainties . New York bonds , which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city 's economy is growing weaker , rose 1\/2 point yesterday .
rate.n | 1 | The latest 10-year notes ended at about 100 16\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 11\/32 to yield 7.93 % on Friday . Short-term interest rates rose at the government 's regular weekly Treasury-bill auction . The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.78 % and the %% rate %% on six-month bills was 7.62 % . Those rates are up from 7.52 % and 7.50 % , respectively , at last week 's auction . Due to the Treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight , yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales .

rate.n | 1 | The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets . A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system . And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest %% rate %% , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault . Signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates .
rate.n | 1 | Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark . Analysts expect further jitters this week . A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base %% rate %% , currently 15 % . That could shove a weak economy into recession . Economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .
rate.n | 1 | Personal spending , which fueled the economy 's growth in the third quarter , was clearly slowing by the end of the period , raising questions about the economy 's strength as the year ends . Personal spending grew 0.2 % in September to a $ 3.526 trillion annual %% rate %% , the Commerce Department said . It was the smallest monthly increase in a year . At the same time , personal income was held down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo , which tore through parts of North and South Carolina in late September .
rate.n | 1 | All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations . Here is the Commerce Department 's latest report on personal income . The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual %% rates %% in trillions of dollars .
rate.n | 1 | With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest %% rates %% of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind .
rate.n | 1 | The reason is simple . When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency . It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax %% rates %% . Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit .
rate.n | 1 | This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency . Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s . The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax %% rates %% in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates . This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle . First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction .
rate.n | 1 | In February 1988 , for example , Merrill Lynch 's weekly commentary announced that `` the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989 . '' The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds . It said long-term interest %% rates %% , then above 9 % , could drop to 7 % by the end of 1989 , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy . The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40 % to 45 % and later to 55 % . But this September -- just when many market economists , including some at Merrill Lynch , believed that Mr. Straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
rate.n | 1 | `` Our business is constantly looking at all these things , '' he says . His new forecast calls for `` a soft landing . '' And it may be right , judging from last week 's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a 2.5 % annual %% rate %% in the third quarter . Mr. Shilling understands Mr. Straszheim 's problems . `` There 's unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers , '' he says . ``
rate.n | 1 | So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher . The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps . There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange %% rates %% free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates . There are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates . And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians , who predict\/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows .
rate.n | 1 | In the British case , Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist . He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in Britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the European Monetary System . While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating %% rates %% to the death . To make matters even more confusing , the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson 's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling . They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows .
rate.n | 1 | We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience . Nearby Paul Craig Roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir Alan . Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating %% rates %% , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .
rate.n | 1 | We would add that in political terms , Mrs. Thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser . In the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery . In particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange %% rate %% target has no credibility . All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy . Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience .
rate.n | 1 | The authority will issue a total of $ 446.5 million of pollution-control revenue bonds . Proceeds of the sale will go to Centerior 's operating subsidiaries to finance the projects , located at a nuclear unit located near Cleveland . The bonds will be issued for a term of 34 years at an interest %% rate %% of 8 % . Goldman , Sachs & Co. is the underwriter .
rate.n | 1 | Another -- and critical -- factor is the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest export market . Even before the China crisis , weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth . Conversely , strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current %% rate %% . Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong 's economic rhythm . Once external conditions , such as U.S. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual .
rate.n | 1 | The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market . As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them . `` Insurance companies will offer a good %% rate %% if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide . `` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % . Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness . ''

rate.n | 1 | `` It 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under Lawson , '' says Malcolm Roberts , a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London . `` There 's very little upside to sterling , '' Mr. Roberts says , but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. Major 's appointment apparently has run its course . But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because Britain 's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual %% rate %% of about 7.6 % and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits . The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year , says Nigel Rendell , an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London . The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday , off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier .
rate.n | 2 | By adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate , we arrive at a baseline program costing $ 1.7 trillion between 1990 and 1994 . Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security . The graph on the right ( which assumes a 4 % %% rate %% of inflation ) , places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30 , 1989 ) . Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations . Step 2 will answer the question : What happens if these increases do not materialize ?

But , in the same circumstances , the returns would be a more extreme 14.6 % and 2.6 % for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund , with its 12 1\/2-year average maturity . `` You get equity-like returns '' from bonds if you guess right on rates , says James E. Wilson , a Columbia , S.C. , planner .

Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity . An interest %% rate %% is guaranteed for between one and seven years , after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities . Some current rates exceed those on CDs . For instance , a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance , Chicago , offers 8.8 % interest for one year or a 9 % rate for two years .
rate.n | 1 | MONEY MARKET FUNDS : That 's right , money market mutual funds . The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present , when %% rates %% seem headed down . With average maturities of a month or so , money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates , with a slight lag . Still , today 's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall , says Guy Witman , an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta .

The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company 's 1989 operating results . In addition , the effective interest %% rate %% on the $ 410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66 % . The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $ 4 million in interest expenses next year , or six cents a share . Shoney 's said the latest restructuring affected bank indebtedness that was incurred to finance $ 585 million of the company 's $ 728 million recapitalization that took place in

She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes is n't likely to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital next year . Property reinsurance %% rates %% are likely to climb first , analysts and brokers believe . `` The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters '' in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe , says Thomas Rosencrants , director of research at Interstate\/Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta . Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses .

September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums , but remained 7.7 % below year-earlier levels , according to figures from NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology . Domestic machine tool plants received $ 303 million of orders last month , up 33 % from August 's $ 227.1 million , but still below the $ 328.2 million of September 1988 , NMTBA said .
rate.n | 1 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica . '' Under the plan , Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60 % of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price , according to officials involved in the agreement . The remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1\/4 % interest %% rate %% . The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from Japan . Treasury officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors , such as Mexico .

rate.n | 1 | An inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9 % annual rate in the third quarter from 5 % in the second . Much of the moderation came from declining energy prices , which have since turned up a bit , analysts said . Consequently , Michael Darby , undersecretary for economic affairs at the Commerce Department , said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter %% rate %% in the final three months of 1989 . But he said he believes the second quarter 's 5 % rate `` will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate . '' Generally , the Bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month .
rate.n | 2 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5 % pace `` good , solid growth , '' although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter . He added : `` Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be , and I think that 's good news . '' But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion %% rate %% in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice president of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco .

Meanwhile , dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session , according to dealers , who noted that Thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent . U.S. GNP rose at an annual %% rate %% of 2.5 % in the third quarter . The implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a 2.9 % annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6 % rate of gain in the second quarter . In Europe , the dollar ended lower in dull trading .

The final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses , which appears on the balance sheet . The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest %% rate %% contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument .
rate.n | 1 | You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only . You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation , which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate . The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation %% rate %% , times basis for the gain . Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation . But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both systems .

rate.n | 1 | Many believe that without a healthy futures exchange , Hong Kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer . In addition , local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their Hong Kong-dollar exposure . The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered %% rate %% , or Hibor . It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's Eurodollar contract , which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate , the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks . If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong .
rate.n | 1 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed exchange %% rate %% of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .

rate.n | 1 | The report , released yesterday , comes as Congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax-revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes . In the corporate realm , the 1986 law abolished the investment-tax credit , scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax , a levy to ensure all money-making businesses pay some federal tax . The combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so-called average effective tax %% rate %% -- the rate actually paid -- of the 250 corporations surveyed reached 26.5 % in 1988 , compared with 14.3 % in the years from 1981 through 1985 , according to the study . In addition , corporations are now shouldering a bigger share of the tax burden , as the authors of the 1986 law hoped . Corporate taxes paid for almost 12 % of federal spending in 1988 -- excluding Social Security -- compared with less than 8 % in the first half of the 1980s , the study found .

But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value . Mr. Greenspan said the inflation %% rate %% , currently about 4 1\/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . '' In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years .

rate.n | 1 | Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs : Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? The Republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax %% rate %% and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings . This is a classic example of the old saying , `` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts .

Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit %% rate %% increases to satisfy the state . The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans .

rate.n | 2 | In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a %% rate %% , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake . Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.

rate.n | 1 | The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies . Trying to manage exchange %% rates %% to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . '' The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .

Tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions . But it did n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping %% rate %% cut . The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market . As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the discrepancy has become ever greater .
rate.n | 1 | With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on , Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway . Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much , announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas . `` The absurdity of the official %% rate %% should seem obvious to everyone , '' the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation . The State Bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away . Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks , but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise .

Total tire segment sales were up only about 1 % to $ 2.2 billion , and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers . In the latest quarter , Goodyear 's tax %% rate %% was 51 % compared with 41 % a year earlier . As a result , total tax outlays were $ 73.5 million , compared with $ 44.1 million the year earlier .

From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time . Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest %% rates %% , though up a bit recently , are still low .

In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation %% rate %% of around 4.5 % as `` much too high to be ignored . '' He added , however , that inflation could be brought down `` close to zero '' without throwing the economy into a recession . Analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future .

Dealers said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year . The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest %% rates %% and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said . The 30-share index fell 33.3 points to 1739.3 . Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares traded , but better than the year 's lowest turnover of 276.8 million Monday .
rate.n | 1 | On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % . Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors . `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , %% rates %% can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . '' Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
rate.n | 1 | The brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell , generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on T-bills or from banks and thrifts directly . T-bills sold at Monday 's auction yielded 7.90 % for six months and 7.77 % for three months , up from 7.82 % and 7.61 % , respectively , the week before . So-called jumbo CDs , typically in denominations of $ 90,000 and up , also usually follow T-bills and interest %% rate %% trends in general more than those aimed at small investors . Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields this week , both up and down . The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00 % from 7.96 % , while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89 % .
rate.n | 1 | As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day , bond prices retreated . But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market . A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest %% rates %% tend to bolster bond prices . On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak . But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August .
rate.n | 1 | Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that %% rate %% increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years . Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies . Wilbur Ross , financial adviser to the equity holders said , `` Given the state 's strong bargaining position ... we believe the NU plan provides the best recovery available '' to PS of New Hampshire 's equity holders .
rate.n | 1 | New England Electric System , Westborough , Mass. , has proposed buying the company for $ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years . The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan . The other bidder is United Illuminating Co. , New Haven , Conn. , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % %% rate %% increases .
rate.n | 1 | Sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-October , dropping 22.8 % to 94,543 from a year ago . The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans 10.4 % below year-ago levels , but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve . Industry analyst John H. Qualls , a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis , forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year , even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle %% rate %% for the quarter . Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2 % drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2 % drop in domestic trucks to 31,143 . The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles , said Joel Pitcoff , a Ford analyst .
rate.n | 1 | For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral . The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount . High default %% rates %% , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high . Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates . In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates .
rate.n | 1 | 2 . Provide better incentives . Given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher . Guarantee %% rates %% are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully . Reducing those rates moderately ( say , to 75 % ) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers . But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults .
rate.n | 1 | So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture %% rate %% of direct tax is so unfair . If you are a salaried man , Amen ! 100 % captured . If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % .

rate.n | 1 | `` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says . David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations . Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of %% rate %% pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains . In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations . The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .
rate.n | 1 | Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest %% rates %% backfired . Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years . In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million .
rate.n | 2 | The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the %% rate %% of economic growth . Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics . If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
rate.n | 2 | Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year . The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes . I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth %% rate %% of real business product . Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services . In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
rate.n | 1 | The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink . `` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in %% rates %% , '' Mr. Ely said . For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion . For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion .
rate.n | 1 | Overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago . Third-quarter sales in Europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings . McDonald 's said that systemwide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange %% rates %% remained in effect . `` Going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder , Peabody & Co . Reflecting better growth prospects abroad , McDonald 's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion .
rate.n | 1 | In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' `` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said . The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest %% rate %% to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % . Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further .
rate.n | 1 | People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower %% rate %% . Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved . And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself .
rate.n | 2 | We ca n't afford to wait . '' But does it have to be so soon ? Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating %% rate %% , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. . Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
rate.n | 2 | `` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors { primarily to greater speed } , '' according to NHTSA . The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 . In states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality %% rate %% rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 . In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year , the same as in 1986 .
rate.n | 1 | But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery . The industrial average ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 points . Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest %% rates %% amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building . Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales .
rate.n | 1 | Yesterday , the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 18\/32 to yield 7.89 % , compared with 102 9\/32 to yield 7.93 % on Monday . The latest 10-year Treasury was quoted at 100 22\/32 to yield 7.88 % , compared with 100 17\/32 to yield 7.9 % . Short-term %% rates %% were unchanged to slightly lower . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 % , while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % . Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
rate.n | 1 | Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . Corporate Issues Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest %% rates %% . Three of the largest offerings , by Exxon Capital Corp. , Xerox Corp. and Citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc . Exxon Capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % .
rate.n | 2 | Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in China 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion deficit last year . The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China 's current-account balance , two of which are considered most likely . In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average %% rates %% of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion . In 1985 , China had a record deficit of $ 11.4 billion . The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months .
rate.n | 1 | `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default %% rate %% of 34 % . One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 . These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by AP Industries , Columbia Savings ( Colorado ) , First Texas Savings Association , Gilbraltar Financial Corp. , Integrated Resources Inc. , Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. , Resorts International Inc. , Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc .
rate.n | 1 | Sales eased 0.2 % to $ 8.88 billion from $ 8.90 billion . Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said that a drop in sales of auto and truck parts contributed to lower earnings in the automotive unit . He also cited unfavorable foreign-exchange %% rates %% and a lower tax rate . Earnings for the group declined to $ 11 million from $ 33 million last year . Earnings at Allied-Signal 's aerospace business rose to $ 55 million from $ 41 million a year ago , primarily on higher sales and profit in its engines and auxiliary power units .
rate.n | 1 | A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year . Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . Belo said it increased its effective tax %% rate %% to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 . The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year .

Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price . The note would accrue interest at the %% rate %% of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund . The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said . The spun-off concern `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said .

In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ( $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange %% rates %% ) , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
rate.n | 1 | Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter . More recently , property rates have increased . Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost %% rates %% even further .

rate.n | 2 | In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback . `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company . Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth %% rate %% of 26 % in the first half . In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier . The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
rate.n | 1 | `` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities . Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . '' Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest %% rates %% to move lower in the coming weeks . That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease . Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall .
rate.n | 1 | Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' The federal funds %% rate %% , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy . Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 3\/4 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report . Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 11\/16 % .
rate.n | 1 | Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 11\/16 % . James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall . `` Given our forecast for lower %% rates %% , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said . Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys . He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .
rate.n | 2 | The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . But the %% rate %% of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .

rate.n | 2 | Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter , causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected . Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter , analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the %% rate %% of gain in foreign orders . The Maynard , Mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .

rate.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest %% rates %% as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
rate.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange %% rates %% will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .

Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange %% rate %% mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
rate.n | 1 | Sounds great -- or does it ? First , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration . Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation %% rate %% and thus given the company a real profit . Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .

'' I call her agent , David Dominici . Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest %% rates %% stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that .

Most of the mailers are free , but Denver-based Financial Programs sells , for $ 15 , a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice . The figures are shocking .
rate.n | 1 | Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest %% rates %% and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .

Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago . `` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added . The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving %% rate %% . Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels . Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession .
rate.n | 1 | Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . In the 15 companies I studied , reversal %% rates %% range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . 3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support .
rate.n | 1 | Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years . That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and %% rates %% are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year . Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years .
rate.n | 1 | Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight %% rates %% . `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
rate.n | 1 | The carriers were competing fiercely for market share . Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said %% rate %% discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros .
rate.n | 1 | And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its %% rates %% a further 25 % over the next two years . Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .

rate.n | 1 | This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 . Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises . Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest %% rates %% again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . '' Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .
rate.n | 2 | First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance %% rates %% on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking . This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
rate.n | 1 | Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level . State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse . A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax %% rate %% . In sum , at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation . Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California 's business school .
rate.n | 1 | But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks . If so , that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so . That , in turn , is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark %% rate %% on many corporate and consumer loans , by half a percentage point , to 10 % . `` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said George R. Mateyo , president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. , Cleveland . But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates . ''

The issue is being sold through Freddie Mac 's 17-member securities selling group .
rate.n | 1 | The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . The House seriously considered raising the top tax %% rate %% paid by individuals with the highest incomes . The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor ( D. , Ark . ) calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating .
rate.n | 2 | It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . The response %% rate %% , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 .
rate.n | 1 | As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . That %% rate %% would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
rate.n | 1 | Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher . Yesterday , the Fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system . The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds %% rate %% to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week . The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans . It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
rate.n | 1 | The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % . Short-term rates rose yesterday . The discount %% rate %% on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday . The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
rate.n | 1 | Mortgage-Backed Securities Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts . Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon %% rates %% of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages . Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 . If the refinancing plan clears Congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
rate.n | 1 | That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value ( plus , in some cases , a sweetener ) . When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest %% rates %% are puny . If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University .
rate.n | 1 | The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 . Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest %% rates %% may fall . But many economists were not nearly as jubilant . The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months , they warned .
rate.n | 1 | The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance . The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day . In the past several days , however , the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest %% rate %% to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets . Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy . Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .
rate.n | 1 | With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage . More than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state . Auto insurance %% rates %% are soaring .

rate.n | 1 | He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates . Moreover , he is a political agent of a political president , who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election , and less to its longer-run health . These days , the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange %% rates %% should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level . How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ? Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ?
rate.n | 2 | These programs vary widely , but often require second opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods . Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans , up from 5 % five years ago . `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term %% rate %% of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study . `` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
rate.n | 1 | Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession , the Commerce Department reported . Work began on homes and apartments at an annual %% rate %% of 1,263,000 units last month , down 5.2 % from August , the department said . The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2 % in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982 , when the country was nearing the end of a recession . Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5 % .
rate.n | 1 | Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March . In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September . `` %% Rates %% have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. Regalia said . `` We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . '' Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .
rate.n | 1 | In early trading in Tokyo Thursday , the Nikkei index rose 135.09 points to 35242.65 . On Wednesday , shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations , traders said . Institutions , meanwhile , stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest %% rates %% remained unclear . The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar , traders said , and by the U.S. trade deficit , which widened by 31 % in August from the previous month . Traders and analysts said they did n't see any effect on Tokyo stocks from the California earthquake .

Ahmanson & Co. , the nation 's largest thrift holding company , posted a 12 % earnings decline for the third quarter while another large California savings and loan , Great Western Financial Corp. , reported a slight earnings gain . H.F. Ahmanson , parent of Home Savings of America , reported third-quarter net of $ 49.2 million , or 50 cents a share , down from $ 56.1 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax %% rate %% to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded , the company said . Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % . For the nine months , Los Angeles-based H.F.

Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil , coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide . A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan 's annual economic growth %% rate %% would eventually be only 0.8 % if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year 's level of 300 million tons . The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month .

rate.n | 2 | Eugene Sit , president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis , says , `` When we bought it , we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds ( the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for Uncle Sam 's check ) . But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth , Mr. Sit says .

That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , H&R Block does n't even come close .

rate.n | 1 | By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment . Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2 % . That same calculation saw profit %% rates %% fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 . Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin . In theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same .
rate.n | 2 | Hence the LBO craze . But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way . The profit %% rate %% is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 . Result : a landscape littered with lemons , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America . The mounting risks did not go unobserved , even in the mid-1980s .
rate.n | 1 | The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up . In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % , a Harvard study published in April of this year ( and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 ) found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 % . What is the consequence of a high-interest burden , high default %% rates %% and continued low profitability ? Corporations need liquidity , in the form of borrowed funds . Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits , they look to the government , which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts .

While last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty %% rate %% , the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant . The bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 , the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before . Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households , William Butz , associate director of the Census Bureau , said that `` most groups either stayed the same or improved . ''
rate.n | 2 | -- Among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge . Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years , the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 . The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty %% rate %% would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % -- under the alternative calculation . Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years .

Since Friday 's dive in stock market prices , the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock market debacle . Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds %% rate %% . They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the Fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level .

The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall 's , Golf World ( U.S. ) and Sailing World magazines ; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange %% rate %% , and an 8.7 % decline in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship newspaper .

It warns that the AIDS epidemic `` may reduce the %% rate %% of growth of the work force , curb productivity gains and slow economic growth .

rate.n | 1 | Meanwhile , the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $ 90,000 fell to 7.93 % in the latest week , according to Banxquote , from 8.10 % the week before . Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding . CDs sold by major brokerage houses , which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest %% rate %% trends , also posted larger drops in yields . A six-month , broker-sold CD , for example , was yielding an average 8.09 % in the latest week , a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before . In late April , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks .
rate.n | 1 | `` What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit '' reported yesterday `` make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote . `` Even before the market drop , rates were down about half a percentage point , '' said Robert J. Hutchinson , senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York . `` That puts pressure on CD %% rates %% .
rate.n | 1 | Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations . Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $ 1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period . The move was meant to keep a lid on interest %% rates %% and to boost investor confidence . `` The intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez , money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . She said a more aggressive move was n't needed .

rate.n | 1 | But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest %% rate %% to decline about one-quarter percentage point . The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks .
rate.n | 2 | Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline , federal researchers report . The drop is particularly large for white males , although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality %% rates %% . A report in this week 's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer , the leading cause of cancer death , should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate . The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer .
rate.n | 2 | `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death %% rate %% from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % . The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites .
rate.n | 2 | The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites . The study , by Susan Devesa , William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute 's staff , also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket , except black men . Although lung-cancer mortality %% rates %% are increasing for the nation as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women . Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 , with sharp increases for everybody but white men . But Dr. Fraumeni , one of the authors of the report , said `` the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future . ''
rate.n | 2 | `` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities . '' An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality `` among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking . '' But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality %% rates %% are rising in developing countries . `` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education . Asked for comment , Walker Merryman , a vice president of the Tobacco Institute , said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech .

The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual %% rate %% of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter . `` Capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said Robert Dederick , economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates .

Peter Drake , biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently .

With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a Chanel look . '' She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .
recall.v | 2 | The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to %% recall %% certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville , N.Y . Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month , following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals . The FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was .
recall.v | 1 | `` I think we did . '' Asked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today . When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and %% recalls %% time spent together in Camden . Details and Camden are essential Florio . Elected to Congress as a `` Watergate baby '' in 1974 , he ran for governor three years later .
recall.v | 1 | Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . '' During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious . Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , %% recalls %% an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices . Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . `` People started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. Miranda recalls .
recall.v | 1 | During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges . But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him , %% recalls %% his close ally Jose Blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua . Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama . Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua .
recall.v | 3 | The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford 's work , is wholly free of this anxiety . The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' . The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to %% recall %% them . We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them . It does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose .
recall.v | 1 | Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her . He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she %% recalled %% that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her . It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea . The brothers drove down together in Mark 's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel .
recall.v | 1 | `` Sally '' , admonished her mother , `` you 've got all evening to visit with Dan . His wounds need dressing now '' . Mrs. Jackson 's words %% recalled %% Dan to his lack of fitness for courting . What a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world . He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap .
recall.v | 1 | On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon . The strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder . The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not %% recall %% any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach . He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him . Into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ; but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest .
recall.v | 1 | Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply do n't understand women . Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician . `` Mr. Jones , you may %% recall %% that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ? Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .
recall.v | 1 | Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I can not say . With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse . The times I can %% recall %% when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host 's chair was vacant ; ; a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn 's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could . These are but a sampling of the insults I endured . As Mrs. Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys ? ?
receive.v | 1 | One of the first people to come to the Deaver home after his troubles erupted was former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman , whom Mr. Deaver scarcely knew . `` He reassured me that the hurricane would end , '' Mr. Deaver recalls . Mr. Bauman %% received %% an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival , Richard Nixon . Says Mr. Bauman : `` If things get really tough , I can always auction it off at Sotheby 's .

Anheuser-Busch plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands , setting the stage for a price war as the beer industry 's growth slows . PS New Hampshire %% received %% a sweetened bid from another suitor , United Illuminating , which valued its new proposal at $ 2.29 billion , apparently topping all others so far . Financial markets quieted , with stock prices edging lower , bonds inching up and the dollar almost unchanged . The Dow Jones industrials closed off 5.94 points , at 2653.28 .
receive.v | 1 | Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. %% received %% a $ 65 million contract to outfit Continental Airlines ' 393 planes with the Bendix\/King Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System . The airborne system operates independent of ground-based radar systems , informing pilots of nearby aircraft , Allied-Signal said . The system also provides course-correction advisories .
receive.v | 1 | The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it %% received %% since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending . The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited . Thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions .
receive.v | 1 | A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 . Under the new Northeast Utilities plan , it would pay $ 1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds . Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would %% receive %% only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds .

Then there is the artifical sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean . Made of sand , it %% receives %% around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves . When the mining in front of the wall is complete , it is moved northward . A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard .
receive.v | 1 | The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he %% received %% and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium . `` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says . Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
receive.v | 1 | In when-issued trading , the notes were quoted at a price to yield 7.78 % . Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak 2.41-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio , which was lower than the average 2.79-to-1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions . The ratio , which reflects the number of bids the Treasury %% receives %% for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand . Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen . Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .
receive.v | 1 | But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members %% received %% amounted to bribes . Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ( $ 880,000 ) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
receive.v | 1 | That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society . Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support . Both residents ' organizations admit to %% receiving %% some funding from abroad . But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .
receive.v | 1 | `` That 's always looking back , '' she said . `` I wanted to be in business . '' On the way to that goal , she %% received %% her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to work for a fund-raising organization . Soon she was running the office . When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist .
receive.v | 1 | However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims . Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 . The trust also will %% receive %% $ 75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville . And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income . Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch .
receive.v | 1 | Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere . Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper . Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that %% receive %% its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era . This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science . John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .
receive.v | 1 | On Saturday , the partners said the team would be purchased for $ 54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc. , a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here . Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team . Under terms of the sale , Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could %% receive %% up to $ 11 million in additional payments from the franchise 's future earnings . Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise . But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing .
receive.v | 1 | As many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years . And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like . Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. %% receives %% 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects . Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood . What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields . ''
receive.v | 1 | After all , he says , `` we 've got like 15 million bureaucrats . '' And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500 . So far , though , Mr. Lesko has %% received %% only one entry . To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss . Mr. Lesko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats .
receive.v | 1 | Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced . The higher payments will start with Social Security checks %% received %% on Jan. 3 , 1990 . Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month . The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year .

receive.v | 1 | Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . With the $ 3 million %% received %% from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . `` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says . All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
receive.v | 1 | Millicom Inc. said it is one of two companies to %% receive %% a license to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan . The market during the start-up is estimated at 25,000 subscribers . A spokeswoman for Millicom , a telecommunications company , said she did n't know the value of the contract .

'' Gross had %% received %% Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case . `` You know '' , the lawyer said , `` it 's difficult to talk like this about a man who ca n't answer back '' . Gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him .
receive.v | 2 | Helion also hoped that America 's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works . `` I arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions '' . In New York he was well %% received %% by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including Alexander Calder , George K.L. Morris , De Kooning , Holty and a few others . After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases . The darkening world scene , at the time of the Munich Pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote Virginia studio .
receive.v | 1 | Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host 's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is %% received %% by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .
receive.v | 1 | Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who %% received %% the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
receive.v | 1 | `` By observing the conductor '' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` I learned how not to conduct '' . The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium . Simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , %% receiving %% sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano . His professional career began when he was twenty ; ; he became Otto Klemperer 's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor . Was n't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? ?
receive.v | 1 | Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in arrears . Wilson made up his mind that he must %% receive %% at least $ 2,500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing . The church itself must be repaired . It was dirty and neglected .
receive.v | 1 | Before them stalked the beadle , proclaiming as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws -- adulterers , thieves , murderers , and lewd persons . Let evildoers contemplate their ways , and let every man beware '' ! ! John 's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just %% received %% from his sister Mary . Charles had died two weeks before , in early November , without being reconciled to the Church . The canons , in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith .
receive.v | 1 | Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ? `` It 's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said . `` We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has %% received %% is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' . His heart , he discovered , was pounding . `` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
receive.v | 1 | The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing . For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had %% received %% no second . But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction . For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .
receive.v | 1 | He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders . But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure . Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was %% receiving %% a much larger salary from parties unknown . He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups . In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .
receive.v | 1 | Little by little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived . They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned . On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally %% received %% written notice that he was fired , they were evicted . Worst of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work . He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded .
receive.v | 2 | I could n't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . There , Mother was %% received %% by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats . But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .
receive.v | 1 | `` What are my chances for taking Joe 's place '' ? ? He asked . `` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it 's all right with me '' .

regard.v | 1 | What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army . The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating . Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , Israel is %% regarded %% by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians . Like Lebanon , Israel is being remade by demography .
regard.v | 3 | `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly %% regarding %% possible side effects . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body .

regard.v | 3 | Interpublic declined comment . The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history . Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties %% regarding %% a possible restructuring . Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak . In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .

Shareholders of Noxell , of Hunt Valley , Md. , will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30 , the companies said . P&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares .
regard.v | 1 | Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we can not %% regard %% `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we can not regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .
regard.v | 2 | He looked at his son , his face worried . Scotty murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . Scotty %% regarded %% the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest . He said more loudly , `` I 'm full , old Pop '' . He had eaten almost nothing on the crested , three-sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container .
regard.v | 2 | Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and %% regarded %% us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .
regard.v | 1 | Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along . The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear . She %% regarded %% them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants . Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them . A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ; today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable .

One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise %% regarding %% a particular person , place , time or thing . A woman met a famous author at a literary tea . `` Oh , I 'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed .
remember.v | 1 | They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition . But they need not be to do their jobs well . Yes , we all can %% remember %% one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days . But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious . In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
remember.v | 1 | In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous . `` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency . `` Most people ca n't even %% remember %% his name . '' ( It is John Hart . ) Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $ 4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there .
remember.v | 1 | If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins . Always . This is worth %% remembering %% when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
remember.v | 1 | By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders . Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance . It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' ( a term which , it is pertinent to %% remember %% , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena . ( That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers .
remember.v | 1 | At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not %% remember %% , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now . We had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .
remember.v | 1 | And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction . A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I ca n't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' . Being a teacher of American literature , I %% remembered %% Whittier 's `` Massachusetts To Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' . There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' . And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves . Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .
remember.v | 1 | These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` %% Remember %% when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled .
remember.v | 1 | Not for years . The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew . It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to %% remember %% going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa 's yellow sick insides . `` No you wo n't '' , Big Hans said . `` Yes , Hans , if they 're needed '' , Ma said .
remember.v | 1 | He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` %% Remember %% the Starbird ? ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down . `` The Starbird , '' Abel said . There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished .
remember.v | 1 | Peasants puzzled Andrei . He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish . Andrei %% remembered %% a Bathyran meeting long ago . Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert . A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched .
remember.v | 1 | They had already lost most of their corn , she thought . Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ? ? She %% remembered %% McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs . At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door . Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .
remember.v | 1 | He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . If Simms Purdew would turn to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened . Lemme tell you now '' -- If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he %% remembered %% and told . It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand . Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air .
remember.v | 1 | To fuck up the program . You guys remember that . %% Remember %% that He heard himself haranguing them . He saw himself before them delivering the speech . He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention .
remember.v | 1 | Mercer , despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat . His own fate he accepted . He %% remembered %% the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan . The dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it . He staggered back to the group .
remember.v | 1 | Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless . Gavin 's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words . `` Do you %% remember %% Big Charlie '' ? ? He whispered . `` He stuck with me all these years . Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .
remember.v | 1 | He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider . Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did . At noontime , %% remembering %% what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball . `` Why ai n't you playin ' ball '' ? ? He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse . `` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .
remember.v | 1 | `` When you got ta go , you got ta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said . Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he %% remembered %% of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley . `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said . `` Can I make you one '' ? ?
remember.v | 1 | I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us '' . `` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ? She said incredulously . `` When I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I %% remember %% a poem I had to read in my lit class . I do n't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets . In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; ; and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .
remember.v | 1 | `` So I just scooted out of his clutches . I swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car . The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I %% remembered %% that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I 'd changed '' . She 'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she 'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool . While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd seen two men on her left at the pool 's edge .
remember.v | 1 | But she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken . Facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool . She %% remembered %% little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it . The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand . The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle .
remember.v | 1 | Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden . Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards . She closed her eyes , %% remembering %% the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
remember.v | 1 | The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky . She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty . Both church and graveyard were smaller than she %% remembered %% them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible . She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss . The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers .
remember.v | 1 | He was determined to hold out . The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich . At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't %% remember %% her face or her touch ; ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him . He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .
remember.v | 1 | Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A 's in math and science . Imagine his son being that good in science ! ! Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he %% remembered %% what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford . But then , he had n't studied very hard . Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking .
remember.v | 1 | It was true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala . The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . He found himself trying to %% remember %% something , but he could n't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .
remember.v | 1 | Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George . Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ? As for Cousin Alexander Carraway , the only thing Theresa could %% remember %% at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma 's call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George . There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot . He had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool .
remember.v | 1 | `` She should have told me herself . And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ? %% Remember %% what happened the last time '' ? ? Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them . Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra 's husband , had n't gone out to fetch her .
remember.v | 1 | And when she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was Harvie Harvie this , Harvie that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing '' ? ? And then I %% remembered %% a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself '' . I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check . The last night I had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me .
remember.v | 1 | But he was always persuaded out . He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never %% remember %% whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .
remember.v | 1 | Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night . If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie . Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to %% remember %% to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie 's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at a time , and he did n't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him . He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they was n't nobody with you . So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz 's mind from funny things .
remove.v | 1 | In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid , Mr. Ortega 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections . Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections . Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to %% remove %% any pressure to hold fair elections . `` My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning '' by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency , he said .
remove.v | 1 | Joseph W. Robertson , 61 , was dismissed from those posts , the company said . He could n't be reached and a company spokesman would n't comment on the dismissal . Mr. Robertson was also %% removed %% from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County , another unit , and the Toms River bank .
remove.v | 1 | Staar Surgical Co. 's board said that it has %% removed %% Thomas R. Waggoner as president and chief executive officer and that John R. Wolf , formerly executive vice president , sales and marketing , has been named president and chief executive officer . Mr. Waggoner has been involved in a dispute with the board since August , when he ousted all the directors . Later they said they fired him , and two directors attempted to place the company under bankruptcy-law protection .
remove.v | 1 | One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . '' By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R . Ms. Volokh quit her job , to %% remove %% herself from the public eye . The wait was miserable . Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier .
remove.v | 1 | AG is hardly alone in its anxiety . A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once-stately insurance business . Worried by European Community directives that will %% remove %% many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars . In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
remove.v | 1 | The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier . Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them . And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to %% remove %% him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . `` The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , '' says Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama . `` He has mastered the art of survival . ''
remove.v | 1 | Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , %% remove %% the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ? That is questionable , to say the least . Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .
remove.v | 1 | He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed . But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board , he met unanimous opposition . The church certainly would not be %% removed %% . The very proposition was sacrilege . It had been here fifty years .
remove.v | 1 | For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant . She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city 's special nursery . Soon they all were %% removed %% to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began . One of the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva 's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells . Instead of kicking feet , Helva 's neural responses started her wheels ; ; instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .
remove.v | 1 | He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step . He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service '' . He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not %% remove %% his gloves -- and light and smoke . He could do that when he would be a man . `` Hey , Laura '' ! !
remove.v | 1 | There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain . `` Have him come in '' . Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously %% removed %% from their customary places . `` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely . An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
remove.v | 1 | `` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is %% removed %% to a mental institution in an ambulance . Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me .
replace.v | 1 | Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates . And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $ 49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March . The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras , %% replaced %% the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988 . While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) said yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . ''
replace.v | 1 | On it , a quarter of the country 's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain , beef , eggs and milk , and nine-tenths of its fruit , vegetables and potatoes . Like the Roman Catholic Church , the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation . Try as they might , the Communists could neither %% replace %% nor break him . And they did try . A few miles past Radzymin , a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice , a village of tumbledown farms .
replace.v | 1 | It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots . Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to %% replace %% the Red Delicious , '' he says . The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon . New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
replace.v | 1 | But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out . Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville wo n't discard his old supply . ( He reports his business is up slightly from customers %% replacing %% old stock . ) CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts .
replace.v | 1 | Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs . At closely held Deltec Securities Corp. , junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise . In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to %% replace %% them . Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said .
replace.v | 1 | Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are %% replaced %% by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices . Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents . Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop .
replace.v | 1 | The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs . So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change . What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to %% replace %% them . Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago . A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
replace.v | 1 | East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker , one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world , in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens . But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc , it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon . For the Politburo %% replaced %% Mr. Honecker , who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus , with a man cut of the same cloth : Egon Krenz , the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege . East Germany , it is clear , is no Poland , where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union . Nor is it a Hungary , where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy .
replace.v | 1 | Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress . That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment . Hands-off the economy was %% replaced %% by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution . In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state's-responsibility '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus . The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .
replace.v | 1 | A meteor could fall on San Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought . Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to %% replace %% our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . Yet we no longer feel uneasy . This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .
replace.v | 1 | It was so dark that he did n't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had %% replaced %% his biwa with a friend . An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
report.v | 1 | It said the situation is caused by efforts to streamline bloated factory payrolls . Unemployment has reached 27.6 % in Azerbaijan , 25.7 % in Tadzhikistan , 22.8 % in Uzbekistan , 18.8 % in Turkmenia , 18 % in Armenia and 16.3 % in Kirgizia , the Communist Party newspaper said . All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union , and all but Kirgizia have %% reported %% rioting in the past six months . The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West . Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an `` Association of the Unemployed '' has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets , or 17 % of the work force .
report.v | 1 | It was an audacious claim . But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers . His was one of two research teams in 1984 to %% report %% dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor . Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer . He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages .
report.v | 1 | For journalists , however , who write what they fondly view as history 's first draft , this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy 's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder . It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is %% reported %% and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target .
report.v | 1 | Cie . Generale des Eaux %% reported %% that net profit climbed 30 % in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25 % for the full year . The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs ( US$ 119.2 million ) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988 . Revenue climbed 13 % to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion .
report.v | 1 | The drop accelerated in this year 's third quarter , underscoring an overall lack of stress in the U.S. economy , the company said . Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10 % in the nine months . The South Atlantic States were the only region to %% report %% an increase in bankruptcies , up 5.3 % to 5,791 from 5,502 . This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged . The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance , insurance and real-estate sector , where bankruptcies grew 8.1 % to 2,046 from 1,892 .
report.v | 1 | Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 725.8 million ) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans , bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$ 1 billion . The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to %% report %% a profit for the year ending Tuesday . The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 . The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions wo n't affect the payment of dividends .
report.v | 1 | On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak . But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August . Auto makers %% reported %% that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units , far less than the 6.6 million units analysts had expected . Taken together , the auto-sales and durable-goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down . Although analysts do n't expect the Federal Reserve to ease credit policy soon , reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates .
report.v | 1 | Since then , deliveries have slumped . GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid-October to 69,980 , while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 . GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers %% reported %% mixed results . All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made cars , including those built at Japanese-managed plants , falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier . The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
report.v | 1 | A retired electrical engineer we 'll call Ben works part-time as a consultant , but he does n't want to earn so much that Social Security reduces his benefits . So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students . He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income %% reported %% on his return . So he asked the IRS if the plan would work . Well , notes IRS private ruling 8934014 , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it .
report.v | 1 | But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out . Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville wo n't discard his old supply . ( He %% reports %% his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . ) CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts .
report.v | 1 | The blue-collar worker who decides to start a business will listen and take advice . His humility gives him a much better chance of success . A few months ago your paper %% reported %% the results of a study to determine why Asians who arrive in this country without any money , and unable to speak English , become overnight successes . Their `` secret '' is that they gather a small group of advisers around them , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they are on their way . Successful American business owners do the same thing .

'' AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government %% reports %% about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing .
report.v | 1 | The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) . The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats . They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they %% report %% in Nature , a scientific journal . They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow . The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
report.v | 1 | Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building . Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers %% reported %% lackluster mid-October sales . The Treasury 's 30-year bond ended over 1\/4 point higher . Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1\/8 to 1\/2 point .

report.v | 1 | Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates . Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was %% reported %% earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say . `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer .
report.v | 1 | But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . Lloyd 's only recently %% reported %% its financial results for 1986 . That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims . But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
report.v | 1 | The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job . Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed . Crime was the reason that 26 % %% reported %% difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving . More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises . In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
report.v | 1 | Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years . The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have languished at their $ 1.8 billion peak . Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all %% reported %% losses in their latest fiscal years . Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons . In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down .
report.v | 1 | Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back . It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who %% report %% low income and large expenses from a part-time business . The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields . For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .

report.v | 1 | But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience . The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research . Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium %% reported %% results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons . The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium . When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .
report.v | 1 | A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported Turgut M. Gur , an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins , head of the Stanford experimental team . One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University . Mr. Bockris previously %% reported %% getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water . He said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium . There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
report.v | 1 | The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it %% reports %% operating results this week . Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
report.v | 1 | What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first %% reported %% last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren ( D. , Okla. ) , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama .
report.v | 1 | Argentina and Britain agreed to resume diplomatic and economic relations , seven years after the two nations battled over the Falkland Islands . The announcement , in which they said hostilities had ceased , followed a two-day meeting in Madrid . Rebel artillerists bombarded the capital of Afghanistan , killing at least 12 people , as the Soviet Union was %% reported %% to be airlifting arms and food to Kabul 's forces . Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war .

But one far-afield effect is still with us .
report.v | 1 | Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces . Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn . Rep. Bill McCollum ( R. , Fla. ) %% reports %% that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics . In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public .

The quake , which also caused damage in San Jose and Berkeley , knocked out electricity and telephones , cracked roadways and disrupted subway service in the Bay Area . Major injuries were n't %% reported %% at Candlestick Park , where the third game of baseball 's World Series was canceled and fans evacuated from the stadium . Bush vowed to veto a bill allowing federal financing for abortions in cases of rape and incest , saying tax dollars should n't be used to `` compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life .

He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions . He was to get involved in no arguments ; ; he was to try to make no converts ; ; he was simply to listen and %% report %% back what he heard . It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent . If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .
report.v | 2 | The buddies invariably took advantage of him . Since he could n't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports . Where the hell did he get off threatening to %% report %% any laxness on their part to the captain ? ? A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him . Ekstrohm had to hide his secret .

'' And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around . For the first nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 pages .
rush.v | 1 | Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings . Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives . With one she is pregnant , with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag , and as the vice president 's wife she %% rushes %% in with white hair , wearing a tailored suit and pearls , imitating Barbara Bush 's gestures down to the last detail . Though it 's clear that Mr. Gelbart 's sympathies do not lie with the far right , it 's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs , taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media . Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language .

The president %% said %% that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda . A simultaneous announcement was made in Moscow . Bush said that neither he nor Gorbachev expected any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''

As the country 's new leader , Egon Krenz , prepared to travel to Moscow today for talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev , hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of Leipzig , Halle and Schwerin to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group . Krenz , however , vowed to preserve the Communist Party 's hold on political power and %% said %% East Germans should n't destabilize the nation with unrealistic demands . Communist officials this month have faced nearly daily pro-democracy protests , accompanied by the flight to the West by thousands of East Germans . Soviet police clashed with demonstrators in Moscow following a candlelight vigil around the KGB 's Lubyanka headquarters in memory of those persecuted under Stalin .

say.v | 1 | Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which , if damaged , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer . Scientists %% say %% the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops . An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention . That is for the future .
say.v | 1 | Right now about a dozen laboratories , in the U.S. , Canada and Britain , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes . They have about seven candidates . Researchers %% say %% the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects .
say.v | 1 | But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth . Despite that , when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. Levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene . The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' %% says %% Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass . Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies .
say.v | 1 | The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes . It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far . In any case , %% says %% Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer .

say.v | 1 | Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed , Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals . If further research proves the seed 's benefits , this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil . `` This seed 's not grown anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world , '' %% says %% T.V. Krishnamurthy , a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd. , a major psyllium buyer and promoter . `` The proper climatic conditions do n't exist in many places in the world . '' Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : `` If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . ''
say.v | 1 | Psyllium needs sandy soil , dew during the first few weeks , and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing . Small crops are grown in Pakistan , France , Spain , Italy , Belgium and Brazil , but their quality ca n't compare to that of Indian psyllium . Big buyers like Procter & Gamble %% say %% there are other spots on the globe , and in India , where the seed could be grown . `` It 's not a crop that ca n't be doubled or tripled , '' says Mr. Krishnamurthy . But no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop .
say.v | 1 | `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen . These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers %% said %% , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change . Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said . Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
say.v | 1 | Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings . `` Climate varies drastically due to natural causes , '' said Mr. Thompson . But he %% said %% ice samples from Peru , Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming .
say.v | 1 | The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras , replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988 . While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) %% said %% yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . '' Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader . While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue .
say.v | 1 | In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid , Mr. Ortega 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections . Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections . Mr. Abrams %% said %% that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections . `` My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning '' by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency , he said .
say.v | 1 | It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras . On Oct. 20 , the town 's mayor , Robert Reid , made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers . `` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' %% says %% Joe Sukle , the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown . `` They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards . They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama . ''
say.v | 1 | That includes his companion of 15 years , Johanna Lawrenson , as well as his former wife , Anita . Both women say they also find it distasteful that CBS News is apparently concentrating on Mr. Hoffman 's problems as a manic-depressive . `` This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie 's life , '' %% says %% Ms. Lawrenson , who has had an advance look at the 36-page script . `` It 's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself . '' Mrs. Hoffman says that dramatization `` makes the truth flexible .
say.v | 1 | `` I do n't talk about my work , '' he says . The president of CBS News , David W. Burke , did n't return numerous telephone calls . One person close to the process %% says %% it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a `` work in progress , '' such as the Hoffman re-creation , but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife . Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment . Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed .
say.v | 1 | As competition heats up in Spain 's crowded bank market , Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities . Under the direction of its new chairman , Francisco Luzon , Spain 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts %% say %% may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization . The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior . The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , holds 8.42 % .
say.v | 1 | As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs . The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts %% say %% . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
say.v | 1 | The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition . But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 . The bank also %% says %% it 'll use its international network to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges .
say.v | 1 | Veiling his message has helped him endure . Art , says the playwright in `` Wedding Song , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take . '' `` Wedding Song '' gives glimpses of a Cairo that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once %% said %% , `` the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty . '' The clutter of the 1940s remains , but its color has drained away , and the will to overcome has been defeated . Cars ca n't move because of overflowing sewers .
say.v | 1 | By October , when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal , even the administration was agreeing little should be done . Mr. Boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month , but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes . `` In the aftermath of Vietnam , in the aftermath of Iran-Contra , I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup , they have to bring their lawyers , '' he %% says %% . But even Mr. Boren defends congressional oversight . Writing in the Harvard International Review , he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a `` consensus . ''
say.v | 1 | He points to a letter on his desk , his second in a week from President Bush , saying that they `` do n't disagree . '' More broadly , Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power . `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he %% says %% . Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation .
say.v | 1 | If they finish today , the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow . One roustabout , hanging by his hands from a ladder , bounces his weight on a three-foot wrench to loosen a stuck fitting . `` We 've been putting in long hours , '' Mr. Ramirez %% says %% -- six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months . A year ago , when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes , `` you 'd spend two days working and two days in the yard , '' he recalls . After a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices , draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs , fear is finally leaving the oil patch .
say.v | 1 | The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer . OPEC Secretary-General Subroto explains : Consumers offer security of markets , while OPEC provides security of supply . `` This is an opportune time to find mutual ways { to prevent } price shocks from happening again , '' he %% says %% . To promote this balance , OPEC now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem . At its November meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy Persian Gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments .
say.v | 1 | Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner , ponying up more than half of the $ 600,000 in drilling and start-up costs . Mitchell will get a half-interest in the oil . `` A kind of no-mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity , %% says %% Don Covey , Mitchell 's oil exploration chief . Now `` everybody is a lot more optimistic . '' One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work .
say.v | 1 | It says 40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 's . Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable . Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official %% says %% . Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back . Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
say.v | 1 | Butch McCarty , who sells oil-field equipment for Davis Tool Co. , is also busy . A native of the area , he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience store . `` First year I came back there was n't any work , '' he %% says %% . `` I think it 's on the way back now . But it wo n't be a boom again .
say.v | 1 | `` We have the money to buy . But operating a U.S. department-store chain would be very difficult , '' says Motoyuki Homma , managing director of the international division at Mitsukoshi Ltd. , one of Japan 's leading department stores . Japanese retail executives %% say %% the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the U.S. is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles . The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U.S. market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo n't translate into success in the U.S. . Japanese department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Allen , however , does n't think that Japan is about to embark on a major buying binge . Nonetheless , speculation heated up yesterday when Tokyu Department Store Co. confirmed a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading business daily , that Tokyu is talking with Campeau about buying Bloomingdale 's . Tokyu , however , %% said %% no agreement had been reached . Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale 's , which bankers in Tokyo estimate could cost between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion . Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale 's chairman , Marvin Traub , and more than half are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say .
say.v | 1 | Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' %% says %% one investment banker who follows the retail industry . `` Looking only at a narrow American strategy is n't where it 's at . '' Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , analysts say .
say.v | 1 | Eiji Nakazato , a Takashimaya general manager , admits that his company 's image is similar to Saks 's and that there is some interest in the idea . But he stops there . `` We 'd like to do business in America , '' he %% says %% . `` But it looks tough . '' Marcus W. Brauchli contributed to this article .
say.v | 4 | But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $ 57.2 million . A statement from the council of cardinals said Catholics had responded generously to an appeal last year to give more money after 1987 's record $ 63 million deficit . The statement %% said %% a 5 % jump in the `` Peter 's Pence '' collection -- the annual offering from Catholics to the pope -- helped cover the deficit . Council member Cardinal Gerald Carter of Toronto told Vatican Radio : `` Now that we say we covered our deficit this year , people are going to relax and say well that 's fine , the Holy See is out of the hole . But we 're ... going to be in the exact same situation next year . ''
say.v | 4 | Mr. Nixon 's office said the former president `` expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders '' and will give his assessment of those leaders to President Bush upon his return . A poll conducted in 12 of 16 NATO countries shows that the Dutch appear to be the strongest supporters of the alliance . The poll , conducted for the Dutch daily De Telegraaf by Gallup International %% said %% 81 % of Dutch people supported NATO . Canada was the second most pro-NATO country with 78 % supporting the alliance , followed by the U.S. with 75 % , Britain with 71 % , Belgium with 69 % and West Germany with 63 % . All other countries registered support below 50 % .
say.v | 1 | Chinese officials are trying to use the Canton Trade Fair to lure back overseas traders after the bloody crackdown on dissent . But attendance is down from previous years . What 's more , a Hong Kong textile trader %% says %% , some Chinese exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown by dragging their feet on soliciting new business . `` They are angry about the government ... so they hold back the goods , '' he said . This autumn 's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31 .
say.v | 1 | In another sign of glasnost , Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's long-banned chronicle of Soviet repression , `` The Gulag Archipelago , '' is now recommended reading in one 11th-grade Moscow history class ... . British customs officers said they 'd arrested eight men sneaking 111 rare snakes into Britain -- including one man who strapped a pair of boa constrictors under his armpits . A customs official %% said %% the arrests followed a `` Snake Day '' at Utrecht University in the Netherlands , an event used by some collectors as an opportunity to obtain rare snakes .
say.v | 1 | Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog , the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of Luzon . Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer English . But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino , %% say %% advocates of the native language . `` For the middle and upper-middle class { Filipino } is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines . There 's also resentment .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat , telling Mr. Mitchell : `` I sense at this stage you may have the votes . '' The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual Senate decorum . Their tone was good-natured , with Mr. Packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell %% saying %% he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again . Although the proposal , authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , appears to have general backing by Republicans , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it . And Democrats , who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at least for now .
say.v | 1 | He called the battle `` uphill . '' Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic . `` There will be no capital-gains bill this year , '' %% said %% Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) . `` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal . The IRA portion ( of the Packwood-Roth plan ) is irresponsible . ''
say.v | 1 | Gerald F. Seib contributed to this article . Japanese immigration authorities said they found 658 more Chinese among Vietnamese boat people , bringing the number of Chinese trying to enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees this year to 1,642 . Japan plans to send the Chinese back home and is negotiating with the Chinese government , a Justice Ministry official %% said %% . The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam who arrived in Japan this year , compared with 219 for all of 1988 , the official said . The 658 Chinese , who have been in a refugee-assistance center , were sent to immigration facilities yesterday pending deportation to China , the official said .
say.v | 1 | Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the `` disappearance '' of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs ( about $ 465,000 ) , there had n't been any stock-taking since 1868 . Tony Lambert , Mrs. Verne 's successor , says the mint 's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs . El Salvador is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses , government officials %% said %% . The state Supply Regulator Institute is to burn rice , corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government , a statement from the information service SISAL said . During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute , then sold at low prices to `` unscrupulous businessmen '' who resold them to the institute at inflated prices , the statement said .
say.v | 1 | Another 250 Libyans were already in Italy to stage a day of mourning for victims of Italy 's colonial rule between 1911 and 1943 , when Tripoli says Rome kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor . Libya 's revolutionary Committees have threatened attacks on Italians if Rome does n't pay compensation . But officials in Rome %% say %% the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between Italy and King Idris , deposed by Col. Muammar Gadhafi in 1969 . Canadian Indians are taking five countries to court in a bid to stop low military flights over their homes , the Dutch Defense Ministry said . Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting , a ministry spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting , a ministry spokesman said . They also wanted to prevent a NATO training base being built in the region , he said . The action , in the Canadian Federal Court , will be against Canada , the Netherlands , West Germany , Britain and the U.S. , the ministry spokesman %% said %% . Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation , an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said . Japan has been testing imported food from Europe since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union , the spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | AGIP , the state-owned energy giant , made the announcement about the gas field last month . Located six miles northeast of Venice , the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas - one-tenth of Italy 's reserves . Alarmed councilors %% say %% the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding . The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply . AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year .
say.v | 1 | The highlight : a `` fragrance control system . '' With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the car 's air-conditioning system . The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee %% says %% Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two . Welcome to the 28th Tokyo Motor Show . Here you can find Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying a `` live fish transporter , '' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels , and Nissan Motor Co. with its `` keyless '' Boga , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner 's fingerprints .
say.v | 1 | There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional . The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility . But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a snail , '' they %% say %% , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . '' Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low . Honda has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey , and a slightly larger cousin , the Gorilla .
say.v | 1 | If the law leaves loopholes , use them . If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one %% said %% I should n't '' and brazen it out . As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . )
say.v | 1 | `` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada 's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization . `` Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire '' between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS , %% said %% Jeffrey Simpson , a columnist in Toronto 's Globe & Mail newspaper . Canada , at times , could be an awkward OAS partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication . In U.N. General Assembly votes last year , Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63 % of the time .
say.v | 1 | Not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings . But many have . `` These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people , '' %% says %% Washington writer Suzanne Garment , who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal . Given their own penchant for book writing , it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art . For there is an emerging protocol -- indeed , an etiquette -- to it .

Another former EPA official , Rita Lavelle , is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges . `` There 's nothing she could do to bring herself back to where she was , '' %% says %% her lawyer , James Bierbower . `` You could say she survived , but it was n't easy on her .

say.v | 1 | Former Rep. Robert Bauman , a Maryland Republican who lost his seat in 1980 after he was caught soliciting sex from a 16-year-old boy , has never regained his professional footing as a lawyer . Mr. Bauman , a conservative , says he was deserted by the right wing . `` Conservatives shoot their own , '' he %% says %% . If the political establishment is reluctant to forgive sexual misadventures , the private sector sometimes will . John Tower was accused of womanizing and boozing during his unsuccessful bid to win confirmation as secretary of defense earlier this year .
say.v | 1 | Ford Motor Co. %% said %% it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by W. Wayne Booker .

These functions are currently performed out of Melbourne , Australia , and at Ford 's headquarters in Dearborn , Mich .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question . For most of the past nine years , he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position . But ever since the Supreme Court 's Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue , the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid %% saying %% anything more unless pressed to the wall . Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion . Mr. Bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it .
say.v | 1 | Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother . In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan . In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush %% said %% he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote . As Mr. Reagan 's running mate , though , Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion . He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life .
say.v | 1 | Quickview Systems Inc. %% said %% it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc. , claiming patent infringement in an element of Apple 's popular HyperCard software program . The suit , filed in Minneapolis federal court , claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display `` only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field . '' The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold .
say.v | 1 | Nonetheless , the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars . In Cupertino , Calif. , Apple said that it believes the case has no merit , and that HyperCard does not infringe `` any valid claims '' of the Quickview patents . It %% said %% it filed an action of its own in federal court in San Jose , Calif. , seeking a declaration that Quickview 's claims are invalid .
say.v | 1 | U.S. Memories Inc. , the venture that seeks to crack Japan 's domination of the memory-chip market , said it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states . U.S. Memories %% said %% it will begin visits during the next several weeks to sites in Austin , Texas ; Colorado Springs , Colo. ; Middletown , N.Y. ; and Phoenix , Ariz .

Amoco , an energy concern , is the operator of the project with a 43.75 % working interest , and other partners include Hydro Congo , the Congolese state oil company , with a 50 % interest , and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. with a 6.25 % stake . Production is expected to be about 40,000 barrels of oil a day after completion of the drilling program .
say.v | 4 | The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division . Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer . News reports %% said %% yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .

say.v | 1 | The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed . Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share . Yesterday , Delmed %% said %% it `` continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA . '' It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination `` would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced . '' While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .
say.v | 1 | While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past . Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour . If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do , `` you ca n't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish , '' %% says %% one lawyer at a large New York firm . `` We 're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989 , but next year we 'll be another story , '' said Robert Freedman , a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett . `` We 're settling down to a less active period . ''

Dennis Block , a partner at the New York firm of Weil , Gotshal & Manges , said that in the first eight months of this year , 89 hostile offers were launched , compared with 157 for the first eight months of What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts .
say.v | 1 | What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts . Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed . Still , some lawyers %% say %% the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy .
say.v | 1 | In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff , the defense accused one of the government 's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff . Mr. Laff 's attorney , John Lang , filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness , Henry Lorin , told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed . The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang %% said %% was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff . In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it . In March , Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy , mail and securities fraud , and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
say.v | 1 | Is n't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. Laff for this crime was the least that you planned for him ? '' Mr. Lorin responded , `` No . '' When Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had taken steps to have Mr. Laff killed , the witness again %% said %% no . Peter Lieb , the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case , declined to comment on the trial . TRUSTEE WHO MONITORED settlement payments to Dalkon Shield claimants quits .
say.v | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications . Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 . The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , %% said %% Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T . The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment . This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said .
say.v | 1 | Sonet , or synchronous optical network , products have more capacity than earlier models . `` These products are the heart of our transmission-product line , '' Mr. Buchner said . He declined to disclose specific prices , but %% said %% each product costs in the tens of thousands , or even hundreds of thousands , of dollars . AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals , Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France 's Alcatel N.V. , which also have announced Sonet-based products . AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products .
say.v | 1 | Earlier this month , the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act . But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work . `` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' %% said %% press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill . Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there .
say.v | 1 | Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies . And while sellers of the equipment and companies `` monitoring '' employees have few qualms , right-to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed . `` New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work , '' %% says %% Janlori Goldman , a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union . `` Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded . '' On the corporate side , companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
say.v | 1 | Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes . Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 . Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' %% says %% John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations . The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . '' Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders .
say.v | 1 | Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years . Both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped . Kidder Peabody & Co. %% says %% it monitors bond-trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy . Eavesdropping by individuals is harder to measure . But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail .
say.v | 1 | `` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . '' The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill . Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill , %% saying %% the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors . Laura Dale , center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in Reno , Nev. , defends monitoring . `` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. Dale , who supervises 350 operators .
say.v | 1 | Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes . And in the past , Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations . But opponents , led by the CWA , %% say %% new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented by unions . The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress . `` Nine to Five , '' a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill , six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses .
say.v | 1 | Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . He %% says %% he has n't yet studied the Dellums bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . '' Still , Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial . A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone .
say.v | 1 | That 's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay . ( After 1992 , the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . ) Now , Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who %% says %% a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness . Next month , talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals . CBS is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender . In the mid-1980s , after ABC had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 Winter Games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices . `` I love Pilson , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' %% says %% Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president . `` And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . '' Rivals carp at `` the principle of Pilson , '' as NBC 's Arthur Watson once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . ''
say.v | 1 | The market changed , he adds . And he is n't the only big spender : NBC will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 Summer Games , and ESPN , 80%-owned by Capital Cities\/ABC , will shell out $ 400 million for four years of baseball , airing 175 regular-season games a year . `` Our competitors %% say %% we overbid them . Who cares ? Maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't , '' Mr. Pilson says .
say.v | 1 | Next October , CBS , for the first time , wo n't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series . `` I 've been struggling against that for years , '' says Jonathan Rodgers , who runs WBBM-TV , the CBS-owned station in Chicago . Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC , '' he %% says %% . That is n't surprising . Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. Pilson says .
say.v | 1 | The CBS plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however . No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . `` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner %% says %% . `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're gone . '' During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks .
say.v | 1 | Price : $ 265 million . But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17 % less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month . Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the GM-Toyota price , %% says %% Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc . Other admen , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges . The Winter Games outlook also is mixed .
say.v | 1 | ( Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $ 25 million to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events . ) Barry Frank , the agent who took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March , says that even if CBS loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little . `` Ten million ai n't jack , man , when you got $ 3 billion sitting in the bank , '' %% says %% Mr. Frank , senior vice president at International Management Group , citing CBS 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses . `` It does n't mean anything -- it 's public-relations money . '' Moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings-getter , says David J. Stern , the commissioner of the National Basketball Association .
say.v | 1 | CBS may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling CBS Records and other businesses . But media-stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says Wall Street wo n't take kindly to that . `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he %% says %% . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says .
say.v | 1 | Meanwhile , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial stocks basically stood still , easing 0.12 , to 452.23 . Despite the Composite 's advance , some trading officials are guardedly optimistic that the market is on the road to recovery . Lance Zipper , head of over-the-counter trading at Kidder Peabody , %% said %% it is difficult to make predictions based on yesterday 's trading volume . The advance felt more like a technical bounce , he said . `` The market acted better , but it was n't a tremendous comeback , '' Mr. Zipper observed .
say.v | 1 | The American depositary receipts of Jaguar jumped 3\/8 to 11 5\/8 on turnover of 1.9 million . Ford Motor said it raised its stake in the British car maker to 12.45 % of the ordinary shares outstanding . In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Ford %% said %% it holds 22.8 million ordinary shares .

say.v | 1 | A major Tokyo newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $ 1.3 billion to buy Bloomingdale 's . Campeau Corp. , the chain 's owner , declined to comment on the report . A spokeswoman %% said %% Toronto-based Campeau has received `` expressions of interest '' in Bloomingdale 's , but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made . Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading economic newspaper , reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning to team up with U.S. and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain , which Campeau has put up for sale . The service did n't identify its Tokyu sources .
say.v | 1 | Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by Bloomingdale 's Mr. Traub . But they said detailed financial figures have n't been passed yet to any prospective buyers . `` Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November , '' %% said %% one investment banker familiar with the discussions in Japan . `` Tokyu is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand . But it 's in very early stages still . ''
say.v | 1 | Dun & Bradstreet Corp. %% said %% business failures fell 17.8 % to 11,586 in the third quarter from 14,099 in the year-earlier period . In the first nine months of this year , business failures dropped 15.6 % to 37,820 from 44,796 . Except for a few spots , notably Georgia , Virginia and Michigan , failures declined almost across the board , according to the business information services company .
say.v | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. %% said %% William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been president since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years .
say.v | 1 | GORBACHEV %% SAID %% Moscow wo n't intervene in East bloc moves to democracy . The Kremlin leader , on the first day of a three-day official visit to Helsinki , assured Finland 's president that the Soviet Union has `` no moral or political right '' to interfere with moves toward democracy in Poland , Hungary or elsewhere in Eastern Europe . In Moscow , the Soviet State Bank announced a 90 % devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions , in an apparent attempt to curb a black market for hard currency .
say.v | 1 | Baker offered to review Israel 's `` suggested changes '' to his proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks . But the secretary of state advised Israel that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at Mideast peace . NATO defense ministers %% said %% the 16-nation alliance continues to need a strong nuclear strategy despite political changes in Eastern Europe . The ministers , concluding a two-day meeting in southern Portugal , welcomed Moscow 's pledges to cut its military forces , but urged the Soviets to do more to slash short-range nuclear weapons . The Justice Department indicated a possible challenge to a court order allowing former National Security Adviser Poindexter to subpoena ex-President Reagan 's personal papers for use in the defense case against Iran-Contra charges .

The city 's mayor vowed to take legal action against developers who had been excavating at the crest of the hill . Czechoslovakia 's premier %% said %% he supports broad political and economic restructuring , but ruled out any dialogue between Prague 's Communist government and independent human-rights or dissident groups .

Fed Chairman Greenspan said the central bank can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but doing so will inflict short-term pain . GM 's Hughes Electronics unit %% said %% profit slid 22 % in the third quarter . The finance unit , GMAC , said net fell 3.1 % , but EDS 's profit rose 16 % .

say.v | 1 | Why has it taken people so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem ? '' asked Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion . Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill . `` While I 'm pleased the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' %% said %% Rep. Ted Weiss . `` Why did it take Burroughs Wellcome so long to apply '' for treatment investigational new drug status ? the New York Democrat asked . `` Let 's not forget this is the same company that has been profiteering with this drug for 2 1\/2 years , '' Mr. Weiss added .
say.v | 1 | Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $ 1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides . And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the Air Force nearly all of the $ 2.4 billion it wants for production of Northrop Corp. 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers , which cost $ 530 million apiece . The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides %% said %% the accord wo n't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the $ 70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon .
say.v | 1 | Richard D. Sutton , 64 years old , chairman of this bank-holding company , was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its First National Bank of Toms River subsidiary . Joseph W. Robertson , 61 , was dismissed from those posts , the company %% said %% . He could n't be reached and a company spokesman would n't comment on the dismissal . Mr. Robertson was also removed from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County , another unit , and the Toms River bank .
say.v | 1 | Also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies . To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday 's trading , late October weather , especially in the Northeast U.S. , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating oil futures trading lackluster . `` We are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' Mr. Bolling %% said %% from New York . In other commodity markets yesterday : GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
say.v | 1 | Futures prices rose modestly , but trading volume was n't very heavy . The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents . Several cotton analysts %% said %% that the move appeared to be mostly technical . Traders who had sold contracts earlier , in hopes of buying them back at lower prices , yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses . Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors , which have been circulating for the past two days , about China purchasing cotton .
say.v | 1 | Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign . This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader %% said %% that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents . He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 . COCOA :

The Montvale , N.J. , unit said the new operating structure `` creates a more focused and responsive organization geared to effectively managing the size and scope of the unit 's current business .

He %% said %% Businessland , which operates stores in 50 U.S. metropolitan areas , planned to absorb his firm 's operations .
say.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers %% said %% the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
say.v | 1 | Neither has plans to be a market maker for now . Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading . Big Board officials %% say %% only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points it did . With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say .
say.v | 1 | With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said . The SEC 's Mr. Breeden %% said %% the after-hours trading on the Midwest exchange would help the U.S. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades .
say.v | 1 | Only 42 GOP members opposed the president 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year . At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte ( R. , Mass. ) , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position . `` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' %% said %% Rep. Henry Hyde ( R. , Ill. ) , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement . But after years of using the issue for its benefit , the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive . New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent , GOP Rep. James Courter , who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent .
say.v | 1 | State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6 % of Coates . The remainder is held by the public and by family interests , a spokeswoman for the French group said .

say.v | 1 | Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street . Traders said that Mr. Greenspan , whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets . Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee , Mr. Greenspan %% said %% the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank . `` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. Greenspan said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy . In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5 % as `` much too high to be ignored . ''
say.v | 1 | International Business Machines Corp. %% said %% it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry . IBM , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here , said it invited many other companies to participate as well , including some from Europe . Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific .
say.v | 1 | And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market . IBM also %% said %% it expects to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing . IBM already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques . IBM said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
say.v | 1 | And IBM said it expects the costs to continue climbing . IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in . But it %% said %% that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s . IBM said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses . The project involving Motorola concerns a technique , called X-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
say.v | 1 | `` We 've been opposed to '' index arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer at Kemper , which manages $ 56 billion , including $ 8 billion of stocks . `` Index arbitrage does n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock . While Mr. Timbers explained he 's `` not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market , '' he %% said %% that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects . We 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're ruining the market . They said , ` Too bad , ' so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them . ''
say.v | 1 | `` It has never been interested in what we think . The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , %% said %% Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash . `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it { program trading } , but they { the exchange } ca n't do it , '' he said . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Timbers countered that `` the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems . '' Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody , the two biggest program trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies . `` We continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable , '' a Morgan Stanley official %% said %% . `` We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week . Michael Carpenter , president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody , said in a recent interview , `` We do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole . ''
say.v | 1 | International Business Machines Corp. agreed to acquire a 15 % stake in Paxus Corp. , an Australian computer-software and information-services concern , for 20 million Australian dollars ( US$ 17 million ) . The investment will be made through IBM Australia Ltd. , a unit of IBM , the two companies %% said %% yesterday . IBM can raise its stake in Paxus to 20 % over three years , but agreed to not go beyond 20 % in that time . Paxus said in a statement it has several `` well developed product and services relationships '' with the U.S. computer company , and plans to expand these links .
say.v | 1 | Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment . Tele-Communications is HBO 's largest customer , and the two have a number of other business relationships . Earlier this year , Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO , executives at both companies %% said %% . The purchase of the Showtime stake is `` a direct slap in our face , '' said one senior Time executive . Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York , where Viacom in May filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime .
say.v | 1 | The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated , or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime . Viacom officials declined to comment . Jerome Kern , Tele-Communications ' chief outside counsel , %% said %% he was n't aware of Time 's legal plans . But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black . '' `` It 's hard to see how an investment by the largest { cable operator } in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive , when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest '' cable operator , Mr. Kern said .
say.v | 1 | But since Time 's merger with Warner Communications Inc. , relations between the two have become strained . Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated . Meanwhile , some legal observers %% say %% the Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom 's antitrust suit against Time . Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service , The Movie Channel , on Time 's Manhattan Cable TV system , one of the nation 's largest urban systems . But yesterday , Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers .
say.v | 1 | But that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks , the agency said . The office , an arm of the Treasury , said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often . Nevertheless , on Capitol Hill , where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing , lawmakers %% said %% they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities . They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws . Sen. Alan Dixon ( D , Ill. ) , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , `` I 'm not a statistician .
say.v | 1 | But John LaWare , a Fed governor , told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating . For instance , he noted , the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites . Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally %% said %% they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination . `` We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years '' to developing examinations for discrimination , said Jonathan Fiechter , a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision . `` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . ''
say.v | 1 | `` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . '' Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC %% said %% it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Fiechter said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of `` testers '' -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers . The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing . Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions , but Mr. Grohl %% said %% the U.S. League of Savings Institutions had n't yet taken any position on the matter .
say.v | 1 | London 's Financial Times 100-share index shed 40.4 points to finish at 2149.3 . At London 's close , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 51.23 points lower at 2611.68 . Dealers %% said %% the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year . The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said . The 30-share index fell 33.3 points to 1739.3 .
say.v | 1 | First section volume was estimated at 900 million shares , up from 605 million Monday . Observers said the market again failed to find a trading focus , discouraging much participation by investors . The market , however , is expected to remain stable and expectations for future gains are high , traders %% said %% . Such sentiment is being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market later this week and in early November . The expected amount is said to be 700 billion yen ( $ 4.93 billion ) to 1.05 trillion yen -- the second largest amount this year in a given period , following the record high set at the end of July , according to market observers .
say.v | 1 | Cutting against the downward trend was Continental , which jumped 4 marks to 346 marks ( $ 187 ) in heavy trading on rumors that the tire maker is about to be taken over . It jumped 7.5 Monday . Traders %% said %% the market was exceptionally thin , as small investors remain on the sidelines . Market participants say investors are not only licking their wounds following the turbulence last week , but they have also been made nervous by two events in West Germany . On Sunday , the governing Christian Democratic Union suffered a series of setbacks , the extent of which became fully known only late Monday , in municipal elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg .
say.v | 1 | Traders say investors are worried that the CDU wo n't be able to hold office in federal elections at the end of 1990 . And statements by the chairman of the IG Metall labor union , Franz Steinkuehler , also cast a cloud over trading , dealers said . Mr. Steinkuehler %% said %% at a convention in West Berlin that the union has to prepare for `` a big fight '' to achieve its main goal of a 35-hour workweek , down from current 37-hour workweek . The decline in prices cut broadly through the blue-chip issues , as Siemens tumbled 7.5 to 544 , Deutsche Bank plunged 7 to 657 , and the auto makers fell sharply as well . Daimler-Benz dropped 12.5 to 710.5 , Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 10.5 to 543.5 , and Volkswagen lost 7.1 .
say.v | 1 | The natural resources development concern said proceeds will be used to repay long-term debt , which stood at 598 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 510.6 million ) at the end of 1988 . The company plans to raise between C$ 75 million and C$ 100 million from the offering , according to a spokeswoman at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. , lead underwriter . The shares will be priced in early November , she %% said %% .
say.v | 1 | The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday . The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 . The bank %% said %% the increase in loan-loss provisions wo n't affect the payment of dividends . The bank said reserves now amount to 61 % of its total less-developed-country exposure . Excluding Mexico , reserves equal 95 % of LDC exposure .
say.v | 1 | BUELL INDUSTRIES Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to five cents a share , payable Nov. 17 to stock of record Nov. 3 . The company 's quarterly dividend had been 10 cents a share since April 30 , 1988 . Buell recently %% said %% it would incur an aftertax charge of about $ 3.6 million in its fourth quarter ending Tuesday , in connection with the sale and discontinuance of several lines at a plant . The Waterbury , Conn. , maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding .
say.v | 1 | So owners have developed a `` code of ethics , '' outlining rules for consultants and agents , and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest . But some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness . `` The industry is based on individual honesty , '' %% says %% Cap Hershey , a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift . Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds , owning one still is n't cheap . At the low end , investors can spend $ 15,000 or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others .
say.v | 2 | Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies . Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday , Mr. Lawson said inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are needed '' to choke it off . The latest government figures %% said %% retail prices in September were up 7.6 % from a year earlier . Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year . David Owen , U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group , reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7 % from 1.2 % and termed the risk of recession next year `` quite high . ''
say.v | 1 | Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69 % decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter , but %% said %% operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period . The Oakland grocery retailer , closely held since a $ 4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $ 7.1 million , compared with $ 23 million a year earlier . But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $ 23.5 million from divestitures .
say.v | 1 | Murata Mfg. Co. %% said %% it is establishing a subsidiary in Britain to produce electric parts , including ceramic condensers . The Tokyo maker of ceramic capacitors said it purchased a plant in Plymouth . The company did n't disclose a purchase price or capitalization figures .
say.v | 1 | Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $ 25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $ 187 million shortly , Richard Miller , president , %% said %% at the annual meeting . He said Wang had reached an agreement with a `` major financial firm '' to sell for $ 150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary . He said it also agreed to sell a portion of its European real estate unit for $ 37 million .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $ 12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $ 13 million from Compaq Computer Corp. , Houston , in the previously announced sale of its Stirling , Scotland , plant . Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $ 200 million to $ 300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang , a minincomputer maker in Lowell , Mass . In response to questions after the annual meeting , Mr. Miller %% said %% the company is no longer looking for an equity investor . During the summer , Wang executives had said they might seek outside investment .
say.v | 1 | On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % . Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors . `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' %% said %% Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . '' Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
say.v | 1 | There is hope of change . Last week , Sen. Malcolm Wallop ( R. , Wyo . ) held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses . `` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses , '' %% says %% Marian Jacob , a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop . Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act , which many feel benefited small enterprises . Thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it .
say.v | 1 | Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules . Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects , says Mark Dooling , president of Dooling & Co. , a Newton , Mass. , architectural firm . There is such a maze of federal , state and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. Dooling %% says %% . Taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies . `` It 's very costly and time-consuming , '' says Phil Rosen , a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc. , a Boston car-leasing company .
say.v | 1 | ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS : Next to medical insurance , `` costs of compliance '' are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc. , a Providence , R.I. , chemical company . Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , %% says %% spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 . Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president .
say.v | 1 | EMPLOYEE MANUALS : Revising employee manuals on pensions , health care and other subjects costs over $ 25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere , president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc. , a Fresno , Calif. , provider of business services to farmers . An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals do n't reflect the most recent laws , he %% says %% . But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that `` you need professionals to help you ; you ca n't do it yourself , '' he adds . PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES :
say.v | 1 | Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews . To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense . `` You need one person to just take care of sales tax , '' %% says %% Jennie Tong , executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc. , New York .
say.v | 1 | The fund has about $ 1 billion and is set up to handle `` precisely the kind of emergency '' the state faces , said Tom Beermann , the Governor 's deputy press secretary . But the fund 's size is disputed by Mr. Brown 's office , which estimates the fund holds from $ 630 million to $ 800 million . Moreover , an aide to Mr. Brown %% said %% Gov. Deukmejian `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this . '' To push through a sales tax increase , however , the state will have to suspend the Gann limit , citing an emergency . And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of the state department of finance .
say.v | 1 | The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes . A Board of Control spokesman %% said %% the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants . `` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use { racketeering charges } is made in individual cases '' by Justice Department officials in Washington , he said . In a memorandum describing the guidelines , Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. %% said %% that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press . '' But Mr. Runkel said the government is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
say.v | 1 | Judge Robert ( `` Maximum Bob '' ) Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday , while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days , plus 120 hours of work with homeless women . Miss Gabor recanted her earlier-expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians . Mr. Bakker %% said %% he was guilty of sin but not fraud . We can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be America 's Celebrity Convict .
say.v | 1 | `` There is strong indication that ` Teddy Z ' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding , '' said John Sisk , senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson Co. , a unit of WPP Group PLC . Last week , `` Murphy Brown '' was viewed by 14.1 % of the available television households , while the number dropped to 12.6 % for `` Teddy Z '' and rose to 14.2 % for `` Designing Women . '' CBS executives %% said %% the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes . Creator Hugh Wilson , for example , included the lead character 's Greek family in the cast , `` but that is not the right focus anymore , '' said one CBS executive . Instead , CBS hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent .
say.v | 1 | The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a `` monster . '' Needless to %% say %% , he was talking about RICO . With its recently revised guidelines for RICO , Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors . The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby .
say.v | 4 | Mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations . In yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report , the company alluded to a $ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations . The report %% says %% that `` the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations . '' A company spokesman , reached at his home last night , would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week . Most oil companies , including Mobil , have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses .
say.v | 1 | Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year . Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified . One Mobil executive %% said %% that the $ 40 million charge related to the action indicates `` a substantial '' number of people will be involved . Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations .
say.v | 1 | The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here . He wo n't for long , because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up . `` There 's no feed , '' he %% says %% . `` You ca n't buy anything nowadays . I do n't know why . ''
say.v | 1 | No phones . No gas . `` We wanted them to build a road here , '' he %% says %% . `` They started , and then abandoned it . '' A tractor , his only mechanized equipment , stands in front of the pigsty .
say.v | 1 | `` I 'm on my own land , '' Mr. Pyszkiewicz says . `` I do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do . '' `` Sometimes , '' %% says %% his wife , `` we 're happy about that . '' By starving the peasant , the Communists have starved Poland . Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors .
say.v | 1 | He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec , two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland 's poorest places . Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village , on a visit to the Communist administrator , the `` naczelnik . '' `` Many people in Poland hope this government will break down , '' %% says %% Mr. Niciporuk , who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity . `` That 's what the naczelnik counts on . He is our most dangerous enemy .
say.v | 4 | Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation , for example , is the Krasnoyarsk radar . -- `` Arms Control Reality , '' Nov. 20 , 1984 , the first of some 20 Journal editorials %% saying %% that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty . -- `` Whether the installation is for early warning or space track , it clearly is not deployed , '' the lawmakers said . `` Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time . ''
say.v | 1 | Sales of North American-built cars and trucks plunged 20.5 % in mid-October from a year earlier , as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year . `` People are waiting for { new } factory giveaways , '' %% said %% Ben Kaye , sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn , Mass. , whose sales are slow . This trend appears to be especially true at General Motors Corp. , which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ignite sales in August and September . Since then , deliveries have slumped .
say.v | 1 | `` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests . A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they %% said %% . But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written , No. 10 of the Federalist Papers . Madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good .
say.v | 1 | But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , %% said %% she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners . Mr. Yeutter , seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 .
say.v | 1 | Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , confirming comments made this week by Vice President Dan Quayle , said Mr. Bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case . But he also %% said %% that exercising a test line-item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the president 's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment .
say.v | 1 | To hear most U.S. growers tell it , we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve . But how sweet it is . It has more sugar `` than any apple we 've ever tested , '' %% says %% Duane Greene , a University of Massachusetts pomologist , or apple scholar . It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says Grady Auvil , an Orondo , Wash. , grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them . `` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside . ''
say.v | 1 | More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety , America 's No. 2 apple . But the apple industry is ripe for change . `` Red Delicious has been overplanted , and its prices have dropped below the cost of production , '' %% says %% Washington State 's Mr. Norton . The scare over Alar , a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , made consumers shy away from the Delicious , though they were less affected than the McIntosh . The glut and consequent lower prices , combined with cancer fears , was a very serious blow to growers .
say.v | 1 | Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , %% says %% Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples . Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree .
say.v | 1 | But in California , says Craig Ito , a Fuji-apple grower , `` There 's a Fuji apple cult . Once somebody eats one , they get hooked . '' Mr. Auvil , the Washington grower , %% says %% that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $ 40 a box if he had them . ( Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places , he adds . ) But his first crop wo n't be picked till next year .
say.v | 1 | But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched . Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures . Sheraton and Pan Am %% said %% they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture . The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $ 140 to $ 150 a day for each of its rooms , and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a Sheraton executive . Thomas Plaskett , Pan Am 's chairman , said the U.S. airline 's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights .
say.v | 1 | And other developers may shift from commercial to residential development in the U.S. . `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago , '' says Charles Shaw , a Chicago-based real estate developer . `` So developers are %% saying %% they will look into distressed properties . They 'll go into someone else 's pasture as long as it 's greener than the one they 're in now . '' Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects .
say.v | 1 | `` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says Jack Rodman , managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm . But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy . The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , %% says %% Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner . And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time . Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
say.v | 1 | `` We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader 's lives , that readers are really involved . '' The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of : the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s . Leonard Lauder , president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder , %% said %% consumer magazines are suffering from what he called `` niche-itis , '' the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers . `` Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars , '' said Mr. Lauder . `` We are being over-magazined .
say.v | 1 | Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down . `` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said Steve Burzon , publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home . And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , %% said %% advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , president of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
say.v | 1 | California , where earthquake damage may top $ 5 billion , plans a special legislative session . Property-tax relief is likely . Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although Gov. Deukmejian %% says %% they should be a last resort . Needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult . But some legislators think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution .
say.v | 1 | The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says . If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly . Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS %% says %% ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them . BRIEFS : Ways and Means veteran Gephardt ( D. , Mo . ) moves to the House Budget Committee ; Rep. Cardin ( D. , Md . ) replaces him ... .
say.v | 1 | Oddly , though , on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system . Unfortunately , the comment was buried in another article , so it could not stand out in an education context . In the Manager 's Journal , Atsushi Kageyama , in commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture , %% said %% , `` Japanese children are raised in a way many Americans would find severe . After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood , they are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school . '' What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful .
say.v | 1 | New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported . Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department %% said %% . Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August . Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
say.v | 1 | Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst %% said %% that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders . Without the increase in defense bookings , September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % . Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
say.v | 1 | Italy 's unemployment rate rose to 12 % of the labor force in July from 11.9 % in April , and was up from 11.7 % a year earlier , according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute . Istat %% said %% a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April , and from 2,853,000 a year ago . The unemployment rate was by far the highest in the southern , so-called Mezzogiorno region . The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3 % in July from 21.2 % in April and from 20.6 % a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | Mexico exported an average of 1,296,800 barrels of crude oil a day at an average of $ 15.31 a barrel during 1989 's first eight months for a total of $ 4.82 billion , Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. said . The state petroleum monopoly %% said %% sales in the period gained 15 % , and $ 262.4 million more than originally projected at an average of $ 10 a barrel on an export platform of 1,250,000 barrels a day .
say.v | 1 | The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said . Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . '' As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he %% said %% . But he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market . Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results .
say.v | 1 | Traders attribute the mark 's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials . But , they add that the mark 's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments . `` The question remains : how much can the West German market absorb ? '' %% says %% one senior dealer . Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita 's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark . Despite the yen 's weakness with respect to the mark , Tokyo traders say they do n't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front .
say.v | 1 | Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat . Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15 , satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the PLO . A U.S. counterterrorism official %% said %% experts are studying the Israeli list . `` We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15 , 1988 , '' he said , referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads . `` So far , this list does n't change our view .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Carmon said he also presented the list last week to William Brown , U.S. Ambassador to Israel . Separately , the New York Times reported that the Israeli government had provided its correspondent in Jerusalem with different documents that Israel said prove the PLO has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories . The State Department %% said %% it has n't yet seen copies of those papers . `` If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' Mr. Carmon asked . Israel has long claimed Mr. Arafat never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the Jewish state .
say.v | 1 | At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails . But U.S. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah , the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories , which the U.S. does n't classify as terrorism . In addition , the officials %% say %% Israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by Fatah or by any group Mr. Arafat controls . U.S. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the New York Times . The papers , which Israel says were discovered in Israeli-occupied Gaza , refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called `` the Revolutionary Eagles . ''
say.v | 1 | Robert J. Penn , president and chief executive officer , will take early retirement from this steelmaker Dec 31 . William S. Leavitt , chairman , %% said %% Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor . UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64 % of the reorganized company 's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust . The company said it would have no further comment .
say.v | 1 | These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . Officials in some of these states %% say %% they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
say.v | 1 | But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel . The question , she %% said %% , is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should ( simply ) revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . '' While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions . I can see both sides . ''
say.v | 1 | Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue . Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said . Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , %% said %% , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . '' Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
say.v | 1 | Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million . By the end of this week , Drexel should have another three to four settlements , Mr. Cohen %% said %% . `` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said . That total would be important for Drexel .
say.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , %% said %% Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
say.v | 1 | It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said . The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large California institutions . `` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' %% said %% Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va . `` This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . '' James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
say.v | 1 | Eagle Clothes Inc. , which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , %% said %% it reached an agreement with its creditors . Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer . Mr. Roth , who has been on leave from his posts , will be succeeded by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc. , which is Eagle 's crisis manager .
say.v | 1 | Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company . At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million . But Eagle %% said %% the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged . Under Chapter 11 , a company operates under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debts .
say.v | 1 | Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen . Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen . Daiwa %% said %% its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term . Operating profit rose 5.5 % to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen . Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen .
say.v | 1 | Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter . Sam Albert , a consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. , said that in the past IBM has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines . He %% said %% he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology . He said he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months . IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
say.v | 1 | Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , %% saying %% that her cash flow had been cut off . The designer , whose line of modular , one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones , has been in a dispute with her latest licensee , Jerell Inc. for several months . Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March .
say.v | 1 | The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % . Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they %% say %% they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . But for the most part , officials have avoided expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
say.v | 1 | Weyerhaeuser Co. %% said %% it sold its wall-paneling business to an affiliate of one of Indonesia 's largest wood-products firms . Terms of the transaction were n't disclosed . Weyerhaeuser said its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in Chesapeake , Va. , and Hancock , Vt .
say.v | 1 | Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market , which grew to $ 77 million last year from $ 33 million in 1987 , according to government figures . Jim Beam Brands Co. , a division of American Brands Inc. , is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor . The company %% says %% it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with bourbon representing most of that amount . Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays . The company 's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan , with 40 % of the market .
say.v | 1 | `` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . '' Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying . He %% says %% that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch . But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks . The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
say.v | 1 | The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' Dr. Blumenfeld %% says %% he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium . `` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says . Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
say.v | 1 | `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it %% says %% the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
say.v | 1 | His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. . Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed . `` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he %% said %% . The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T. 's strong points . Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
say.v | 1 | Her commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area . Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district . `` It 's worse than I thought , '' she %% said %% . `` I do n't know where all the buses are . '' But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out .
say.v | 1 | There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role . The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush . Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , %% says %% it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work . Of Bechtel 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay . Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
say.v | 1 | One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay . But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . Although one transportation official %% said %% drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
say.v | 1 | ( He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . ) CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . With some new rules , state officials %% say %% they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts . Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks . Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered .
say.v | 1 | Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' %% says %% Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently . But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in .
say.v | 1 | A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features . Silicon Graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future . `` It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30 % to 40 % a year , '' %% said %% Edward McCracken , the company 's chief executive officer . Silicon Graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off . Revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 86.4 million , a 95 % increase over the year-ago period .
say.v | 1 | The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation . `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' %% says %% Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work .
say.v | 1 | A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant ( not at Litigation Sciences ) $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine . Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick . `` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' %% says %% Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co . He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . '' But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken .
say.v | 1 | Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors . `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies %% says %% .
say.v | 1 | MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products . The price was n't disclosed , but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd. , the MCA unit , said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $ 20 million . The 40-year-old Buddy L concern , based in New York , designs and develops toys under the names `` Buddy L '' and `` My First Buddy , '' he %% said %% . MCA said it expects the proposed transaction to be completed `` no later than Nov. 10 .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned . `` The magazine is strong . It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. Lipstein %% said %% . `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp.

say.v | 1 | The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by Reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ 1.79 billion . The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc . The departures , %% said %% Alice Ruth , an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences . `` I think it 's more an issue of style . I would view it as a net positive .
say.v | 1 | Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided . An accountant did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . `` I guess I was naive , '' he %% said %% . There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense . Corporate managers who want to start their own business are the highest failure risks .
say.v | 1 | Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 . Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith %% said %% leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group . Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction . The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
say.v | 1 | `` They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together , but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan , '' he said . Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners . `` Five years ago , magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser 's big ad schedule for their magazine , '' %% said %% Mr. Murphy . `` But the marketplace changed . Advertisers now say ` Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . '
say.v | 1 | A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall . That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts %% say %% they think durable goods orders fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout .
say.v | 1 | `` We think we 're on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration , '' he said . `` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter . '' Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he %% said %% the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market . In major market activity : Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 135.9 million shares .
say.v | 1 | The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo . Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez %% said %% the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year . The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk . Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods .
say.v | 4 | Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads . The report to Congress %% said %% that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates .
say.v | 1 | Although Italy 's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known , this marked the first time the unit and product were named . The U.S. is worried about the convertibility of Olivetti 's machine tools to military use . However , an Olivetti spokeswoman %% said %% OCN-PPL , of which Olivetti sold the majority interest last year , `` does n't make equipment that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions . '' Conservationists say that drift-net fishing threatens to wipe out much of the world 's tuna stocks in a few years . But the Japanese Fisheries Association criticized moves to ban the practice in international waters .
say.v | 1 | In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path . Earlier this year , Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds , or down to 20 . Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman %% said %% . The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses . The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly plant at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 .
say.v | 4 | Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People 's Bank of China in Shenzhen , 15 major cases have been found , the paper said ; the biggest was the theft of $ 235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988 . The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models . But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily %% said %% . Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details . Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco , the Japan Association of Travel Agents said .
say.v | 1 | MINORITY RECRUITING has yet to meet hopes raised by Bush administration . Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they %% said %% was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring .
say.v | 1 | Many companies have set up machinery to assure workers a fair shake . At most firms , though , it 's the immediate supervisor who decides the merit increases subordinates will be paid . Managers have `` some very broad discretion , '' %% says %% an official at Walt Disney Co . Unocal Corp. 's top management sets guidelines , but line supervisors slice up the merit pie . Lotus Development Corp. feeds its evaluations into a computer , but only for storage ; the decisions are made by supervisors .
say.v | 1 | In Japan , by contrast , companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within . The Japanese also are accused of keeping their cards too close to their vests . `` Some Japanese executives are not yet ... comfortable about sharing strategic information with their American colleagues , '' the researchers %% say %% . Americans stay longer with Japanese firms than American companies . But they think promotions are limited .
say.v | 1 | She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time . Part of the problem , though , may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor . Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas %% says %% it has n't had any problem recruiting , even after a nurse contracted the virus while injecting an AIDS patient . `` I can tell you that nobody quit over it . No one panicked , '' a spokeswoman says .
say.v | 1 | `` There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who know their responsibilities , '' he says . THE CHECKOFF : At least somebody gains on layoffs . The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms %% says %% the industry 's volume has soared tenfold since 1980 , to $ 350 million a year ... . And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89 , the benefits test fought by most employers . Triad Solutions says software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now have no use .
say.v | 1 | Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . The antibody then kills the cell . Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , %% said %% their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days . In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said . Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed .
say.v | 1 | The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they %% said %% . The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''
say.v | 1 | `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara %% said %% there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . ''
say.v | 1 | Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir . A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan . But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , %% said %% if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir .
say.v | 1 | France 's industrial production index for July and August rose 1 % from June and was up 4.6 % from a year ago , according to seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistics Institute . The state agency , which usually publishes the data on monthly basis , but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months , %% said %% the advance was led by output of consumer goods , which rose 3.5 % from June and was up 7.2 % from a year earlier . Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing , with a monthly rise of 2 % and a year-on-year advance of 3 % . Food production was ahead 1.7 % from June and 5.3 % from a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | South Korean exports to the U.S. during the period fell 1.6 % from a year ago to $ 15.06 billion , while imports from the U.S. soared 26 % to $ 11.56 billion . The trade surplus with Europe was pegged at $ 414 million , down 57 % from a year ago . Officials %% said %% South Korean exports to Europe dropped 5.3 % to $ 3.02 billion while imports from there went up 17 % to $ 2.61 billion .
say.v | 1 | WINSTON-SALEM , N.C. -- First Wachovia Corp. %% said %% John F. McNair III will retire as president and chief executive officer of this regional banking company 's Wachovia Corp. and Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. subsidiaries on Dec. 31 . Mr. McNair , 62 years old , will be succeeded by L.M. `` Bud '' Baker Jr. , 47 , the parent 's chief credit officer and head of its administration division . Mr. Baker will relinquish his previous positions , but a successor for him has n't been named yet .
say.v | 1 | The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 1.71 billion during the first eight months of 1989 from $ 807 million a year earlier . Imports continued to outpace Philippine exports , despite gains in shipments abroad , the government National Statistics Office %% said %% . Exports reached $ 5.12 billion , up from $ 4.52 billion a year earlier , while imports rose to $ 6.81 billion from $ 5.33 billion . The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $ 1.09 billion for all of 1988 .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Koenig will build the corporate-finance and investment-banking business of Gruntal , which has primarily been a retail-based firm . He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. until July , when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr. , who then became the sole chief executive . Yesterday , Mr. Blum , 41 , said he was n't aware of plans at Ladenburg to name a co-chairman to succeed Mr. Koenig and %% said %% the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes . Mr. Blum added he was n't surprised Mr. Koenig resigned , but his departure was `` nothing that we desired or worked for . '' Mr. Koenig said : `` I just got a tremendous offer from Gruntal .
say.v | 1 | Lloyd 's of London %% said %% it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years . Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for three years , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation . When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
say.v | 1 | The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , Lloyd 's said . As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open . Lloyd 's %% said %% it expects to enact new rules mandating the changes by year end . Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably . In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors .
say.v | 1 | The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials %% said %% nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
say.v | 1 | The department 's Office of Thrift Supervision said that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are biased , but conceded that it does n't have data about applicants to determine why blacks are rejected more often . Emergency crews searched through the charred rubble of a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near Pasadena , Texas , where a series of explosions Monday killed at least two people and injured 124 . Company officials %% said %% 22 workers were missing and presumed dead . Safety authorities did n't immediately know the cause of the blasts . NATO defense ministers opened a two-day meeting in Portugal to assess the alliance 's nuclear-weapons needs amid reduced East-West tensions .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Wolf and other members of the board declined to comment on the announcement . Mr. Waggoner could n't be reached . The Staar board also %% said %% that John R. Ford resigned as a director , and that Mr. Wolf was named a member of the board .
say.v | 1 | Early in the day , bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight-to-quality '' rally . That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe . `` Some retail accounts , such as commercial banks and pension funds , wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' %% said %% Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis . At one point , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided to remain independent . In response , Treasury prices soared 1 1\/8 points , or about $ 11.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
say.v | 1 | TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains . Donaldson Lufkin would n't comment . Credit analysts %% said %% investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt . Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular . Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday .
say.v | 1 | Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen . Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers . `` Interest by Japanese investors was limited , '' %% said %% Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . `` They are typically not active in two-year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal . '' However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
say.v | 1 | The bonds were won by a Goldman , Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % . They were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20 % in 2009 . The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter %% said %% . Mortgage - , Asset-Backed Securities Mortgage securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with Government National Mortgage Association 8 % securities as the standout issue .
say.v | 1 | SCI TV 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire Nov. 16 . It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt . Negotiations `` have started con - structively , but that 's not to %% say %% we like this particular offer , '' says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc. , adviser to SCI TV junk-holders . No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly . But it 's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett did n't manage to boost SCI TV 's operating profit after the buy-out .
say.v | 1 | People who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders %% say %% that 's not enough . They contend that SCI TV 's equity now is worthless . They add that it is n't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think contributed to SCI TV 's current problems .
say.v | 1 | This could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for KKR , he adds . A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish KKR 's name , and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in Washington and elsewhere . But others %% say %% junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting SCI TV into bankruptcy-law proceedings . While KKR does n't control SCI TV which is unusual for a KKR investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. Gillett . Bankruptcy specialists say Mr. Kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour LBOs recently when KKR restructured foundering Seaman Furniture , doubling KKR 's equity stake .
say.v | 1 | December copper opened near Monday 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day . Stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price . William Kaiser , president of the Kaiser Financial Group in Chicago , %% said %% the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market , which partly reflected a weakening economy . He said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing . Mr. Kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago . But though a weakening economy implies reduced demand , Mr. Kaiser said that Third World copper-producing countries have n't any choice but to sell copper . They might even step up sales in a falling market , he %% said %% , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries . Technically , Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level . When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their positions .
say.v | 1 | `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . '' She %% said %% copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday . However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year . Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .
say.v | 1 | According to Mr. Threlkeld , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries . `` It takes three months to turn copper concentrate into cathodes , '' he said . If there is n't a recession , he %% said %% , `` we will be out of copper by the end of March . If there is a recession that will change the statistical situation . '' He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ 1.65 a pound , which was reached last year .
say.v | 1 | He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized . Ms. Raptopoulos thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar . `` Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did '' yesterday , she %% said %% . Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday , which is historically high . `` The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather . The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday , said Dale Gustafson , a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago . As for other export customers , the Soviet Union is n't expected to be back buying U.S. corn in significant amounts until early next year , he %% said %% . A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March , indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter . COCOA : Futures at first continued the rally begun on Monday , but then faltered and closed lower .
say.v | 1 | Japan 's production of cars , trucks and buses in September fell 4.1 % from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association %% said %% . Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2 % fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas , according to the association . The association said domestic demand grew 8.8 % in September .
say.v | 1 | He also said the introduction of a 3 % consumption tax in April has helped sales . The new tax , though a source of general resentment among Japanese taxpayers , replaced a higher commodities tax that applied to automobiles . Japanese domestic motor-vehicle sales rose 12 % in September , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association %% said %% earlier this month . The manufacturers ' association will issue statistics on vehicle exports later this month . Production of cars rose to 801,835 units in September , a 5.5 % increase from a year earlier .
say.v | 1 | An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way . The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said . Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House %% said %% the congressmen 's letter is under review . The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years . Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber . In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps , he denounced the senators ' action . `` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. Hastings %% said %% . For the future , he said he would run for governor of Florida . Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country .
say.v | 1 | Harsco Corp. said it obtained a $ 33.1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment . Harsco declined to say what country placed the order . The company %% said %% it received an order for 23 of the vehicles , which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged , and an option for 16 more . Delivery is to begin in early 1991 . Harsco produces products for defense , industrial , commercial and construction markets .
say.v | 4 | China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year , a Western government report %% says %% , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit . According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 . A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports .
say.v | 1 | The company sells image . Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons . The Maidenform name `` is part of American pop culture , '' %% says %% Joan Sinopoli , account supervisor of the campaign by Levine , Huntley , Schmidt & Beaver , a New York ad firm . Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . You never know where she 'll turn up . ''
say.v | 1 | Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker . Mr. Lesk could n't be reached to comment . But Maidenform officials %% say %% that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job . `` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says James Mogan , 45 , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk . The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people .
say.v | 1 | It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc. , the intimate apparel division , and Playtex Family Products Corp. , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products . Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel . Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , %% says %% Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously . When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says . The company could command a good price in the market .
say.v | 1 | Each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings . `` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. Brawer says . Executives %% say %% Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product development . In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales . Her father , William Rosenthal , designed the then-dress making company 's first bra in the 1920s , which he said gave women a `` maiden form '' compared with the `` boyish form '' they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time .
say.v | 1 | Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says . He notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing . In addition , he %% says %% , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . '' And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. Durkin says , `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . '' Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . ''
say.v | 1 | When Robert McDuffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon , Ga . Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending . `` I threw such a fit , '' %% says %% Mr. McDuffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six . `` But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball ... . Afterwards , I went home and practiced for three hours . ''
say.v | 1 | `` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ? That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . '' `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he %% says %% , `` because she taught me how to listen . Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber .
say.v | 1 | Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month . But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone . `` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' %% says %% Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst . But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . '' This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
say.v | 1 | Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers . Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs . It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' %% says %% Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology . The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division . Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
say.v | 1 | But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed . Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars . Some critics %% say %% they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price . Nevertheless , Kodak could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur . `` Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going , '' says RIT 's Mr. Spaull .
say.v | 1 | Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , %% said %% it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group . Rhone-Poulenc , a chemical and pharmaceutical company , said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $ 900 million . It did n't release terms of the transaction .
say.v | 1 | Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems . Although an Imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit , he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit . Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive %% said %% the companies had n't yet been served with the suit . In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here , shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial , its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company 's assets . Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either .
say.v | 1 | Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds . Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more . `` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' %% says %% Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum . Just last week , would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock 's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off , foiled . `` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
say.v | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. %% said %% it will lay off 75 to 85 technicians here , effective Nov. 1 . The workers install , maintain and repair its private branch exchanges , which are large intracompany telephone networks .
say.v | 1 | She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car . Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she %% says %% . Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''
say.v | 1 | GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features . Cadillac may be on to something . Some 60 % of the survey respondents %% said %% they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag . More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 .
say.v | 1 | `` I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks . I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza . So I %% said %% , ` Hello . ' And she said , ` Hello . ' Can you imagine ?
say.v | 1 | `` They ca n't help talking about the big important people they know , even if they do n't really know them , '' says Dr. Freudenberger . Beauregard Houston-Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name-dropper . `` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he %% says %% . Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol . `` I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party . These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . `` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' %% says %% Mr. Revson . `` It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . '' But name-dropping has other benefits , often civic .
say.v | 1 | `` Most people ca n't even remember his name . '' ( It is John Hart . ) Mr. Rambo %% says %% that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $ 4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there . `` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains . Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers .
say.v | 1 | He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis . He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions . `` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler %% says %% . There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name-dropping . Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
say.v | 1 | In New York society , Pat Buckley , the very social wife of author William Buckley , has the nicknames `` Mrs. Buckles '' and `` Patsy . '' And her husband sometimes calls her `` Ducky . '' `` But call her ` Patty , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , '' %% says %% Joan Kron , editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine , a monthly publication sent to all the right names . John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets . That 's because they only drop `` mere names , '' says Mr. Churchill .
say.v | 1 | Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating . `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' %% says %% Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company . In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so . Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe Treasury securities .
say.v | 1 | What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds . Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs . At closely held Deltec Securities Corp. , junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser %% say %% the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise . In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them . Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers .
say.v | 1 | Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress . And , Deltec %% said %% , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said . Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
say.v | 1 | `` I have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us . This market teaches us to be humble . '' The junk market 's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson , '' he %% says %% . Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says Stuart Reese , manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio . `` But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse .
say.v | 1 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' %% says %% Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
say.v | 1 | `` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles . Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds . Mr. Cornell %% says %% : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . '' Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found . During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
say.v | 1 | Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market . In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips . Military buyers have shown interest , National %% says %% , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation . And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .

say.v | 1 | Cray Research Inc. %% said %% it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems , the Cray Y-MP\/832 , to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office . The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between Cray and Control Data Corp . The supercomputer , which lists for $ 18.5 million , will be installed in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office 's headquarters in Bracknell , England .
say.v | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen %% says %% he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
say.v | 1 | Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project . Several medical concerns , including Pfizer Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach . `` It 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries , '' %% says %% Dennis A. Sokol , president of Medical Service Partners Inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together . Some U.S. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale . One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health .
say.v | 1 | `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you turn it off ? '' That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she %% said %% , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) . `` If you are born to give parties , you give parties . Even in Russia we managed to give parties .
say.v | 1 | She was the child of relative privilege . Her mother was a translator ; her father was `` the eternal vice director . '' `` I emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , '' she %% said %% with a giggle . `` But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one . You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez %% says %% he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously .
say.v | 1 | `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names { of the senators } will be brought out , '' Mr. Gonzalez says . This is raising eyebrows . `` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this , '' %% says %% Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group . `` There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position . ''
say.v | 1 | He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others . Rep. Jim Leach ( R. , Iowa ) %% says %% the Lincoln S&L affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making . '' A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally . But the witness , William Crawford , California 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that .
say.v | 1 | But the witness , William Crawford , California 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that . `` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday . But he %% said %% he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions . The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall 's predecessor , Edwin Gray . He has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting .
say.v | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel %% said %% . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
say.v | 1 | Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said . Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units . First Executive %% said %% the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business . In addition , analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding . Each of the units consists of two warrants , each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock , and one depositary preference share .
say.v | 1 | The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . Detrex is setting aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . In addition , the manufacturer %% said %% it signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $ 1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $ 48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute .
say.v | 1 | SHEVARDNADZE ADMITTED that Moscow violated the 1972 ABM treaty . In a foreign-policy address before the Soviet legislature , the foreign minister conceded that the radar station in Krasnoyarsk breached the superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and %% said %% it would be dismantled . Shevardnadze said it took Gorbachev 's government four years to determine that the station 's location in Siberia violated the accord , as Western arms-control officials have long contended . He also denounced Moscow 's nine-year involvement in the war in Afghanistan , saying it involved `` gross violations of ... civil norms and ethics . ''
say.v | 1 | A crowd estimated at 100,000 held a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman %% said %% . The space shuttle Atlantis landed at a desert air strip at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , ending a five-day mission that dispatched the Jupiter-bound Galileo space probe . The five astronauts returned to Earth about three hours early because high winds had been predicted at the landing site .
say.v | 1 | The ministers are to reshape NATO 's defenses in Western Europe amid fast-paced changes in the Soviet bloc . Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . Washington rejected the bid , %% saying %% the hostages were n't linked to other issues . PLO leader Arafat asked Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula .
say.v | 1 | Amtech Systems Inc. , Tempe , Ariz. , said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate `` substantial improvement '' over the previous fiscal year . Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , %% said %% profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are estimated at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million .
say.v | 1 | The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $ 1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds . By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and his party 's largest state delegation in the House . `` I have no regrets about going forward , '' %% said %% Rep. Vic Fazio ( D. , Calif. ) , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting . `` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . '' The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
say.v | 1 | Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . Exxon %% said %% in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct . The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
say.v | 1 | The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard . The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . '' Alaskan and Coast Guard officials %% say %% Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . Use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .
say.v | 1 | Gerald C. Beddall , 47 years old , was named president of the Clairol division of this pharmaceuticals and health-care company . He succeeds C. Benjamin Brooks Jr. , who will retire Nov. 1 . Mr. Brooks declined to give his age , but he %% said %% his leaving is a normal retirement . Mr. Beddall had been executive vice president of the division since April . Clairol , which makes hair and skin products , was a division of Bristol-Myers Co. before that company 's merger with Squibb Corp .
say.v | 1 | Relatively stable foreign currency dealings Monday were viewed favorably by market players , traders said . But institutional investors may wait a little longer to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar , traders said . Hiroyuki Wada , general manager of the stock department at Okasan Securities , %% said %% Monday 's trading was `` unfocused . '' He said investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term . The selective approach blurred themes such as domestic-demand issues , large-capitalization issues or high-technology shares , which had been providing at least some trading direction over the past few weeks , Mr. Wada said .
say.v | 1 | Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August . `` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities %% said %% . `` It 's better to wait . '' The Financial Times 100-share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7 .
say.v | 1 | Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in quiet dealings after recovering most of their early losses . The DAX index eased 0.99 point to end at 1523.22 after falling 5.5 points early in the session . Brokers %% said %% the declines early in the day were partly caused by losses of the ruling Christian-Democratic Union in communal elections in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg . The start of a weeklong conference by the IG Metall metal worker union in Berlin is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations , which could boost companies ' personnel costs next year , they said . But there was little selling pressure , and even small orders at the lower levels sufficed to bring the market back to Friday 's opening levels .
say.v | 1 | The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges . The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August , prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market . Traders %% say %% that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street , the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data . They noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day . In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen late Friday .
say.v | 1 | But GAF 's bellwether role was short-lived . The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document . After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial %% said %% they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22 . Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June . A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government .
say.v | 1 | Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time . Environmental lawyers %% say %% virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
say.v | 1 | In federal court in Manhattan , three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs . James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs . The posters were sold for $ 1,300 to $ 6,000 , although the government %% says %% they had a value of only $ 53 to $ 200 apiece . Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million . Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali , who died in January .
say.v | 1 | When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash . But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors %% say %% there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market . `` Their principal asset is Manville common stock , '' says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville shares . `` If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
say.v | 1 | `` Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , '' the person close to the trust says . Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring . Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , %% says %% the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders .
say.v | 1 | Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term . Its stock , at 9 5\/8 , trades at about 8 1\/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers . Mr. Bullock %% says %% 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management .
say.v | 1 | So far , as a price-conscious shopper , Manville has n't bought much . Paul Kleinaitis , an analyst at Duff & Phelps , says , `` Even though they have borrowing power , they have been disciplined about acquisitions . '' And Mr. Kleinaitis %% says %% that with 80 % of its stock in friendly hands , Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul . Manville ( NYSE ; Symbol : MVL ) Business : Forest products and roofing
say.v | 1 | AEG AG and Siemens AG %% said %% they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January . The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field . AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
say.v | 1 | Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower . The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . `` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' %% said %% Joel Marver , chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group . `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said . The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1\/2 point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % Friday .
say.v | 1 | So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . While some %% say %% the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp .
say.v | 1 | The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off 1\/8 to up 3\/8 point . An official with lead underwriter First Boston %% said %% orders for the San Antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds .
say.v | 1 | Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude , analysts say , now the facility wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability . The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . A company official %% said %% the explosions began when a seal blew out . Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said . There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company .
say.v | 1 | Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices . For instance , one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ 20 a barrel . `` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he %% said %% . In other commodity markets yesterday : COPPER :
say.v | 1 | For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts %% said %% , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . '' A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
say.v | 1 | But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level . He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move . Sandra Kaul , research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton , %% said %% the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast , a major cocoa producer .
say.v | 1 | Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally . But he %% said %% Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S. . `` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the U.S. , '' he said , adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 . Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .
say.v | 1 | Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co . Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications . He will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has %% said %% he will retire in December . Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra . American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra .
say.v | 1 | But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine ( The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client ) . `` He asked me not to resign . The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman %% said %% . Mr. Sorrell , traveling in the Far East , could n't be reached . Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September .
say.v | 1 | `` I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him { to Mr. Sorrell } as my successor . Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. Roman asked . He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and %% said %% that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut . Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units . `` I consider this a second career , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients . `` Ken was my key contact , '' %% said %% J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers . `` I do n't know { Mr. Phillips } all that well . I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . ''
say.v | 1 | `` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill . But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition . `` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , %% said %% Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert . `` It 's probably a reasonable transition . Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York . ''
say.v | 1 | Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 . The New Jersey paper , like the New Haven , Conn. , paper , was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract . Industry analysts have %% said %% that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances . Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers . David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .
say.v | 1 | But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . The company %% said %% its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year . Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers . Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .

Insurance analysts %% say %% the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses ( including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland ) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo . Lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion .

Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .
say.v | 1 | Canada 's consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 % in September from August , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , %% said %% . The rise followed boosts of 0.1 % in August , 0.7 % in July and 0.6 % in June .
say.v | 1 | The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters %% said %% their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . '' Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
say.v | 1 | Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores . Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called American-style cigarettes . `` We are n't Philip Morris Cos. , '' %% says %% Bertrand de Galle , chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A. , known as Seita . He says that because Seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done . ( Last year , for example , Seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million French francs ( $ 73.5 million ) on sales of FFr 27.68 billion - a 1.7 % profit margin . )
say.v | 1 | Japan 's Finance Ministry strongly denied playing any role in the New York stock-price free fall . Makoto Utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , %% said %% the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out . The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , Mr. Utsumi said . `` There are no facts { behind the assertions } that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview .
say.v | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also %% said %% some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks . All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . Bank analysts %% say %% ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads . `` The { ministry } thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified . `` The { ministry } wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added .
say.v | 1 | Despite Mr. Sumita 's statements , it is the Finance Ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions . While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever , Japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game . Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts %% say %% . Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas . Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network .
say.v | 1 | `` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . '' Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty . A spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did %% say %% that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the November mayoral election . ( General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . ) Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold .
say.v | 1 | But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted . In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee , First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate . First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , %% said %% it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities . `` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' Michael Raoul-Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview . The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said .
say.v | 1 | The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said . Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible . An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee %% says %% some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . '' Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . '' Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state . Rochester Telephone %% said %% the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed . Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin . Since June , Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms .
say.v | 1 | `` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said . The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . A Pentagon official %% said %% the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts . Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget . That would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters .
say.v | 1 | The New York Stock Exchange %% said %% a seat was sold for $ 500,000 , unchanged from the sale Thursday . Seats are quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked .
say.v | 1 | He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically %% said %% that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
say.v | 1 | Groupe AG 's chairman %% said %% the Belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider . Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock . Since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs ( $ 2.7 billion ) .
say.v | 1 | They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said . Any raider would find it hard to crack AG 's battlements . A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens %% said %% , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares . Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi , the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas , a Belgian savings bank , and various family interests . A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control .
say.v | 1 | CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 . The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs , %% said %% Jay R. Cohen , Champs executive vice president . CRI , which sponsors Champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm .
say.v | 1 | Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman %% said %% the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .
say.v | 1 | Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year . An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman %% said %% . The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London . Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
say.v | 1 | `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said . Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals ( a role usually filled by a minicomputer ) , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer . `` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman %% said %% . He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line . The machines will cost around $ 16,250 on average in Europe .
say.v | 1 | Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said . The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities . GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of the virus , officials %% said %% . More than 700 people work in the GTE building . The cafeteria remains closed .
say.v | 1 | The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said . Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said . `` From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening , '' %% said %% Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director . `` It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis . '' GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
say.v | 1 | When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory . Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room . He also %% says %% he is losing money now . He blames imports . But just down Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made , Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather .
say.v | 1 | Jindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year . Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made . High-end U.S. furriers %% say %% these imports have n't squeezed them . But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick , who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district , say imports have cut their sales . A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 .
say.v | 1 | Other furriers have also benefited from leathers . Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment . He %% says %% it accounts for 25 % of total sales . Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales . This year he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
say.v | 1 | The British Petroleum Co. PLC %% said %% its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea . In an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
say.v | 1 | `` This sets things way back . '' Continental 's logic : It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related . `` We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate '' family affiliation with legal documents , %% says %% Jim O'Donnell , a senior vice president . But gay rights advocates are angry , too . The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
say.v | 1 | The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' %% said %% Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group . In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
say.v | 1 | More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company . Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings . The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers %% said %% stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled . Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . ''
say.v | 1 | `` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine . In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley ( D. , Wash . ) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change . Mr. Bush %% said %% he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately . In June , the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the First Amendment .
say.v | 1 | HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank . The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday , HomeFed %% said %% . The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits , federal regulatory powers or company operations , a spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook . The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year . Hoechst %% said %% the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand .
say.v | 1 | At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' I call her agent , David Dominici . Yes , he %% says %% , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that .
say.v | 1 | John Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know . He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he %% says %% . The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns . `` We 're all a little greedy .
say.v | 1 | The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . Such schemes , %% says %% Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
say.v | 1 | `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . '' ( Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation . He %% says %% he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . ) For some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived . `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
say.v | 1 | `` People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . But Mr. Wenz , who %% says %% he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy . When he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . '' Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
say.v | 1 | Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches . But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . Psychologists %% say %% isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves . For instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? ''
say.v | 1 | He urged them to refer their friends , who also lost money . ( Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . ) `` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' %% says %% Terree Bowers , chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles . `` We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling . Anything to make a sale . ''
say.v | 1 | Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him . Mr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invested some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns . `` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' %% says %% Mr. Cortese . `` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . '' The investment is worth about $ 130 today .
say.v | 3 | Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns . But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention . In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , %% say %% , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination . Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .
say.v | 1 | Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , %% says %% Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
say.v | 1 | Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund , there would also be $ 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years . Not everyone is so pessimistic . `` People are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' %% says %% Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington . He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more .
say.v | 1 | Their compounding effect is also alluring . In June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 . But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , %% says %% zeros are particularly ill-suited . Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal .
say.v | 1 | Meanwhile , in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced . Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here . `` They seem to like these industrial parks , '' %% says %% Kacy McClelland , a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud . `` We call them fraud farms . '' Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach .
say.v | 1 | Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges . Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors . `` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones %% says %% , `` but no intent to defraud . '' Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .
say.v | 1 | An admittedly limited survey by NASAA , whose members are state securities-law regulators , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million . The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother . What 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' %% says %% Mr. Stapf , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected . So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . Nobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery .
say.v | 1 | Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , %% says %% that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff . ( Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization .
say.v | 1 | One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each %% says %% he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
say.v | 1 | They want it back . Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for court . But he does %% say %% that all of his activities have been `` entirely proper . '' On the suit by the limited partners , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs . The suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . ''
say.v | 1 | He declines to go into specifics . Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone to sue . `` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he %% says %% . Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore . He now calls himself an `` investment banker . ''
say.v | 1 | When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? Pencils down . If you 're like most people , you %% said %% it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding . `` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
say.v | 1 | Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . `` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' %% says %% John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . `` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future .

say.v | 1 | The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies . Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . The surge in production , analysts %% say %% , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
say.v | 1 | Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . Mr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each . Dealers %% say %% the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . `` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend .
say.v | 1 | `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now . `` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he %% says %% . Why Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . He probably has n't done it for the cash .
say.v | 1 | CalMat Co. %% said %% it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million . CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
say.v | 1 | The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty %% says %% profits will be flat or lower . And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
say.v | 1 | The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , %% says %% discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
say.v | 1 | With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest . `` The industry is overbuilt , '' he %% says %% . `` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available .
say.v | 1 | `` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says . Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations . Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , %% says %% the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales . He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . '' Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg .
say.v | 1 | Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He %% says %% courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
say.v | 1 | Hewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users . The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn . Hewlett-Packard %% said %% it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines . The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
say.v | 1 | Silver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . `` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers . While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar %% says %% . Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
say.v | 1 | Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers %% say %% . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
say.v | 1 | Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he %% says %% . Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .
say.v | 1 | `` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house . A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report . This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , %% says %% Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton . `` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. O'Connell says . Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say .
say.v | 1 | Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say . Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland . Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he %% says %% . However , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most . Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week :
say.v | 1 | The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . A technical analyst %% said %% there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
say.v | 1 | But whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . '' Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , %% said %% that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound .
say.v | 1 | The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts . The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 . `` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' %% said %% Peter R. Kann , president of Dow Jones . `` We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs . Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers . ''
say.v | 1 | Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results . But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . `` The results were fascinating , '' he %% said %% . On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat . The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
say.v | 1 | The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested . `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he %% said %% . Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on .
say.v | 1 | Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory %% said %% researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
say.v | 1 | The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies . This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' %% says %% one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' Rep. Ronnie Flippo ( D. , Ala. ) , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change . `` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
say.v | 1 | And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . `` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' %% says %% a 30-year-old East German doctor . `` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning .
say.v | 1 | THE U.S. . IS REQUIRED to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plans . Under guidelines included in an exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives . The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials %% said %% . Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . The shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several hours earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif .
say.v | 1 | The incident occurred Saturday night . The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting . Scientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. %% said %% . The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells . Died : Alfred Hayes , 79 , former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Saturday , in New Canaan , Conn .
say.v | 1 | American Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA . No safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said . An FDA spokesperson %% said %% the drugs are still available under other brand names . Last month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit . It also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry .
say.v | 1 | Alusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. . Alusuisse , of New York , declined to %% say %% how much it expects to get for the unit ; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders . Alusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. , a Zurich , Switzerland , producer of aluminum , chemicals and packaging products . Consolidated , which had 1988 revenue of $ 400 million , makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal , Ohio , and Jackson , Tenn. , rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run , W.Va .
say.v | 1 | Lep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group %% said %% a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . It noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction . Lep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said .
say.v | 1 | WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp . The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , %% said %% $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program .
say.v | 1 | Lotus Development Corp. is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to Infotechnology Inc. , the New York parent of Financial News Network , people familiar with the negotiations %% said %% . They said the price would be around $ 10 million . Signal , which has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable , provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that can be received by specially equipped personal computers .
say.v | 1 | Chambers Development Co. %% said %% its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $ 2.1 million of annual revenue . Purchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry . Terms were n't disclosed .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp . Separately , the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski , a consultant . The company also %% said %% it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $ 750,000 .
say.v | 1 | Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' %% says %% Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . `` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
say.v | 1 | Falconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form . `` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president %% says %% . Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . `` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says .
say.v | 1 | The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months . In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year . `` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman %% said %% . The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company . Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses .
say.v | 1 | Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. %% said %% they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $ 1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G . Shareholders of Noxell , of Hunt Valley , Md. , will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30 , the companies said . P&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares .
say.v | 1 | Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They %% said %% the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .
say.v | 1 | I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . '' Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' Sen. Boren %% said %% the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules . But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress . Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October .
say.v | 1 | One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . In addition , both administration and congressional officials %% said %% the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups .

Breweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , traders %% said %% . Sapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070 . Housings , constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks .
say.v | 1 | Sir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed . B.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares . Dealers %% said %% it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week . In other active shares , Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading , while Hillsdown Holdings , a food products concern , was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases . Elsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan .
say.v | 1 | MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company %% said %% it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters . Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\/casino and theme park .
say.v | 1 | That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University %% said %% they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year . Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . `` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
say.v | 1 | `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years . Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . '' Robert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , %% said %% `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions . Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ''
say.v | 1 | Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he %% said %% . Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years .
say.v | 1 | Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week . But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday . This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound , economists and foreign exchange market analysts %% say %% . `` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said Chris Dillow , senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute . `` If there is another bad trade number , there could be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted Simon Briscoe , U.K. economist for Midland Montagu , a unit of Midland Bank PLC .
say.v | 1 | The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago . This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 . Mr. Dillow %% said %% the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises . Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''
say.v | 1 | USACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible . The Bonanza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets . The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court , USACafes %% said %% . The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
say.v | 1 | HHS OFFICIALS expect Secretary Sullivan to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue . Before he was confirmed , Sullivan said he had `` reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research . '' But now , an official %% says %% , he is `` surrounded by right-to-lifers , '' who contend that any breakthroughs in fetal-tissue research could increase the demand for abortions . COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe . Britain , France and Italy pull out of a proposal to build new NATO frigates ; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects .

say.v | 1 | Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett %% said %% , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . '' The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information . Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said .
say.v | 1 | Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy . One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies . Moreover , he %% said %% , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory .

After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . `` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to %% say %% an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ?

Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor .

They do indeed want their own nation . The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa , with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races , blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress .

He %% said %% , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
say.v | 1 | But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map . Which is what the Old Guard fears . `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state , '' %% says %% Michael Simmons , a British journalist whose book on East Germany , entitled `` The Unloved Country , '' was published this month . Up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy , followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise . Neither man achieved perfection .

The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick . As a result of their illness , the Beebes %% said %% , they lost $ 1.8 million in wages and earnings . In addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome .
say.v | 1 | Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He %% said %% that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said .

The two that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage . State officials %% said %% the court 's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area . `` This project is ready to move , '' said State Urban Development Corp.

say.v | 1 | As part of the agreement with the state , the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending . Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $ 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs . Also , he %% said %% , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will be appealed . The plan , which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district . State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel .

The 77-year-old official , who oversaw the building of the Berlin Wall , was removed during a meeting of the 163-member Communist Party Central Committee in East Berlin . Honecker , who was reported ill following gall-bladder surgery in August , %% said %% he was resigning for health reasons . He was succeeded by internal-security chief Egon Krenz , 52 , a hard-liner who quickly ruled out any sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . Honecker 's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule .

Britain 's Prime Minister Thatcher told a Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , that sanctions against South Africa were `` utterly irresponsible , '' officials %% said %% . But other nations at the opening of the 49-nation meeting of Britain and its former colonies pressed for continued or stronger embargoes in an effort to end apartheid . Arab officials in Saudi Arabia said three-week-old talks by Lebanese lawmakers aimed at ending Lebanon 's civil war appeared about to collapse .
say.v | 1 | The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat , that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did . But as soon as the accords were signed , American officials sharply reduced aid . In February 1989 , when the Soviets %% said %% they had completed their pullout , the U.S. cut it further . Not so the Soviets . Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime .
say.v | 1 | Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them . And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . `` The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , '' %% says %% Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama . `` He has mastered the art of survival . '' In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival .

Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials %% say %% . His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison , Major Omar Torrijos , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service . The spy network would serve two clients : the Panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the U.S. , by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles .
say.v | 1 | The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials . `` We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , '' says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner . For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner %% says %% . `` In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters .

Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration , says Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee . `` Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin , '' he %% says %% . An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials . Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula .

Mr. Gurria 's optimism contrasts with some bankers ' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the U.S. Treasury in order to succeed . Mr. Gurria , Mexico 's under-secretary of the ministry of finance , met yesterday with European bankers in London , at the half-way point on a so-called road show to market the package around the world .

But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and %% said %% , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked .

We can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by going along . It is refreshing to %% see %% at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs . Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain 's voters will decide who is right about Europe , sanctioning South Africa or running Britain 's economy .
see.v | 3 | One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market . Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign . This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who %% see %% higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents . He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 .

Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season . `` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen . `` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
see.v | 3 | In addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage .

Two big stocks involved in takeover activity %% saw %% their short interest surge .

see.v | 3 | Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait . Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one .

'' Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . Such steep drops in a category %% seen %% as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .

Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants %% saw %% these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .

Despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome . Some lawyers and scholars %% see %% the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .

The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring .
see.v | 1 | Residents of this city soon will be %% seeing %% ads urging them to visit `` Cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- Lake View Cemetery . Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times . So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign .
see.v | 3 | Treasury , Agency Securities Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp . The initial bond offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts , is n't expected to %% see %% robust demand . A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds . In when-issued trading , the Refcorp bonds were quoted at a price to yield 8.17 % .
see.v | 3 | China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year , a Western government report says , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit . According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace %% seen %% in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 . A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports . The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much .
see.v | 3 | If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've %% seen %% , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice president - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios . And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
see.v | 3 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to %% see %% defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
see.v | 3 | It was the kind of snubbing rarely %% seen %% within the Congress , let alone within the same party . Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez . It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez , who is investigating the $ 2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association .
see.v | 2 | Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous . `` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works . It is easy to %% see %% why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage . Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject . Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
see.v | 3 | Gill & Duffus Ltd. , a British cocoa-trading house , estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous year . Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies . Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last %% seen %% in the mid-1970s . At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon . But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level .
see.v | 2 | `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't %% see %% a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
see.v | 1 | For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending . The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year . Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after %% seeing %% Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead . Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing . In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes .
see.v | 3 | Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . Every issue is multisided . This film attempts to show a side rarely %% seen %% in our media . Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only . Salaam .
see.v | 4 | And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers . Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony ( who gets a deduction ) must report the former spouse 's Social Security number . Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to %% see %% whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns . But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention . In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
see.v | 1 | So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market . Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative . Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade ( %% see %% accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 ) . Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment .
see.v | 3 | Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last %% seen %% in the mid-1970s . `` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says .
see.v | 3 | Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . `` But we certainly like what we 've %% seen %% so far . '' But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
see.v | 5 | In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle . 2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach . %% See %% that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
see.v | 3 | Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post . BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics . Despite %% seeing %% his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation . Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir , for backing down on the elections , and at Shamir 's rival , Peres , for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker 's plan . Meanwhile , some U.S. officials fear PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
see.v | 1 | In its annual economic report for 1989-1990 , the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3 % . EC inflation was seen at 4.8 % in 1989 , higher than 1988 's 3.6 % price rise . However , inflation for 1990 was %% seen %% slowing to 4.5 % . Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was Ireland , seen growing 5 % at constant prices . Slower growth countries included Greece , at 2.5 % , the U.K. , at 2.25 % , and Denmark , at 1.75 % .
see.v | 3 | But do n't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket . Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5 % this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year 's 4.1 % rise . Next year may %% see %% a drop of one percentage point . Beef prices , hovering near records since the drought , could drop in earnest this winter if ranchers expand herds . Lower feed prices may help animals eat more cheaply , but humans have to factor in an expensive middleman : the processor .
see.v | 2 | We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such . The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it . You %% see %% , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him . Now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done . To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it .
set.v | 6 | Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in %% setting %% off the cancer . But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared . Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer .
set.v | 3 | In broadest terms , stability has quietly settled into international oil markets . Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now . `` The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are %% setting %% oil prices , '' says Victor Burk , an Arthur Andersen & Co. oil expert . After years of wild swings , oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $ 15 to $ 20 a barrel . That is n't the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago .
set.v | 6 | But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling . They believe the media , including `` Batibot , '' have played a crucial role . According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , `` Batibot '' does n't %% set %% out to advance the cause of Filipino . `` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it . '' These days , `` Batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment .
set.v | 6 | How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself ? Well , CBS , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid . But Mr. Pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of %% setting %% off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid . `` The price of poker has gone up , '' crows Charles M. Neinas , the College Football Association 's executive director . With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $ 2.5 billion for four years of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business .
set.v | 4 | `` It has never been interested in what we think . The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee %% set %% up after the 1987 crash . `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it { program trading } , but they { the exchange } ca n't do it , '' he said . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
set.v | 1 | Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates , and Mr. Bebear 's trip will take him to Idaho , Arizona and New York after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been %% set %% in Texas , Ohio and Kansas . California 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications . Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa .
set.v | 4 | The state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis . To raise more highway funds , a measure to double the state 's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years is %% set %% to appear on the state 's June election ballot . But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure . Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs .
set.v | 1 | They use 60 % more fertilizer per acre , twice the high-grade feed . Yet their best boast is that they produce 32 % of Polish pork . `` I 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized , '' Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife , Wieslawa , %% sets %% some chairs out in the sun . `` We have one near here . There is a lot of waste .
set.v | 3 | The state attorney general 's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms , charging them with responsibility for much of a $ 200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer 's office in 1987 . The suit %% sets %% the firms ' liability at more than $ 185 million . The firms are Morgan Stanley & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , County Natwest Government Securities Inc. , Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman , Sachs & Co . The firms have all said that West Virginia 's suit is without merit .
set.v | 3 | USX Corp. said it delayed the proposed initial public offering of common stock of RMI Titanium Co. because of market conditions . RMI Titanium is owned jointly by USX and Quantum Chemical Corp . USX , which had n't %% set %% a date for the offering , did n't disclose any timetable for the offering .
set.v | 4 | PAY FOR PERFORMANCE hangs mostly on boss 's subjective view . Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity . Many companies have %% set %% up machinery to assure workers a fair shake . At most firms , though , it 's the immediate supervisor who decides the merit increases subordinates will be paid . Managers have `` some very broad discretion , '' says an official at Walt Disney Co .
set.v | 3 | He said even though there was arbitrage buying in New York because of the weak dollar , cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders . But he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa . The December contract reached its life-of-contract low of $ 975 a ton on Oct. 11 ; its lifetime high was $ 1,735 , %% set %% in 1988 , and its recent high was $ 1,368 , set in early August . The last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974 . But while further modest declines might be ahead , Mr. Hafer said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high .
set.v | 5 | In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer . Take Cleveland . It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk %% set %% his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
set.v | 1 | Detrex , which has annual sales of about $ 100 million , declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter . The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . Detrex is %% setting %% aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . In addition , the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $ 1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $ 48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute .
set.v | 3 | When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads . The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity . But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate %% set %% by Congress ? For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ? What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ?
set.v | 4 | Mrs. Garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia 's congressional staff . The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities . U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand %% set %% the Garcias ' sentencing for Jan. 5 . FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm . The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York .
set.v | 6 | Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami . `` These guys prey on human frailties . '' While the promises of big profits ought to %% set %% off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
set.v | 6 | So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . The proposal has %% set %% off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff .
set.v | 1 | `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that %% sets %% him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev .
set.v | 6 | Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades . America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship . Before American foreign policy %% set %% out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates . For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period .
set.v | 3 | My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern %% set %% by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .
set.v | 3 | A storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames . Later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire ; ; at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the K'ang-si pottery to cinders . Wright %% set %% his loss at $ 200,000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed . In spite of the disaster , Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing . Amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of Albert Johnson 's $ 20,000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away .
set.v | 4 | Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion . This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy . So when textbooks , like that of Baker %% set %% out drawings of the ' Ptolemaic System ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically . It is the chief merit in Copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent . He can not , e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth 's own motion .
set.v | 6 | The best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him . Incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation . And the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to %% set %% out to write an incest story . Which brings to mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal theme . `` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is also a story about a boy 's love for his mother .
set.v | 4 | And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to %% set %% up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations . We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .
set.v | 1 | One might say it combines the man ; ; own pride and humility . For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another . His light blue eyes , %% set %% deep within the face , are actively and continually looking . He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face . The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .
set.v | 6 | The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve . It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions . It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will %% set %% off a kaleidescope of visual designs . Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content '' . Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
set.v | 5 | He must take it from `` the red box '' . In point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman 's right . The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without %% setting %% off a screeching klaxon ( `` It 's real obnoxious '' ) . Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation 's most guarded secrets . The codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof `` unique device '' .
set.v | 4 | The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush . Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew . Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , %% setting %% up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol . Warren eased his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an A[fj] . This he placed within quick reach .
set.v | 5 | He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes . `` Hey '' ! ! Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes . Winston apologized and quickly %% set %% the hat right . Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves . Winston enjoyed seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style .
set.v | 1 | `` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook . Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier '' ? ? A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been %% set %% out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous . Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered . Travelling home on a late train ? ?
set.v | 6 | Helva 's civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens . One such group got all incensed over shelled `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen . When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and %% set %% the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs . Very few committees ever looked past the first few photos . Most of their original objections about `` shells '' were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed .
set.v | 4 | Your wife 's in terrible shape '' . `` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly . Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and %% set %% the table . When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl . He said , `` I 've got some supper ready '' .
set.v | 3 | Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang . They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses . Billy decided to %% set %% an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort . On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch . It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
set.v | 3 | `` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive . Make it come off all right .

set.v | 6 | His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing . Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed . %% Setting %% a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face . When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression . He knew now what he was up against .
set.v | 4 | He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven . Supper would be ready within the hour . The Maguire family was %% setting %% up a separate camp nearby . Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon 's and his father 's wagon . Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .
set.v | 4 | Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky . Our camp was in the center of a wide valley . Montero had %% set %% up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush . He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire . The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .
set.v | 5 | They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way . She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater . Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost %% set %% her bedspread on fire . She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it . Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .
set.v | 6 | My very first time . I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren . And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had %% set %% in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered . I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness . Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .

My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . You have unwittingly %% set %% in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be in your shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .
share.n | 2 | Ad Notes ... . EARNINGS : Omnicom Group Inc. , New York , reported third-quarter net income rose 54 % to $ 5.6 million , or 22 cents a %% share %% , from $ 3.6 million , or 15 cents a share , a year earlier . Revenue increased 20 % to $ 246.6 million from $ 204.8 million .
share.n | 2 | The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period , including $ 11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama . In the 1989 period also , interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago . In the first nine months , profit rose 10 % to $ 313.2 million , or $ 3.89 a %% share %% , from $ 283.9 million , or $ 3.53 a share . Sales rose 6.7 % to $ 4.27 billion from $ 4 billion . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Kimberly-Clark closed at $ 66.50 a share , up $ 1.50 .
share.n | 2 | No wonder . Nissan , Japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's fourth-largest , was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival , Toyota Motor Corp. , but also by Honda Motor Co. , the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan . Nissan 's market %% share %% in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade . Its U.S. sales sagged , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen . Worst of all , Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting , cronyism and corporate rigidity .
share.n | 2 | These days Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust . Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ( $ 868 million ) in the fiscal year ended last March 31 , a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier , when the company lost money on operations . Nissan has increased earnings more than market %% share %% by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales . But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year , a modest increase of 4.7 % . The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota .
share.n | 2 | Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS . The two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to Columbia 's movies . In addition , Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia 's 35 % stake in the sprawling Burbank , Calif. , studio that Warner and Columbia %% share %% , in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp . Still , it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week . One , for example , came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff , who will head a committee that will oversee Sony 's entertainment division , including both records and movies .
share.n | 2 | FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL Corp. declared a special dividend of one %% share %% of Class B common stock for each share of Class A common stock , payable to holders of record on Nov. 10 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves this as the effective date of the registration statement . Shareholders of the Santa Ana , Calif. , title-insurance company approved the creation of this second class of stock , which will be traded on the national over-the-counter market and which the company said would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes .
share.n | 2 | UNIFIRST Corp. declared a 2-for-1 stock split . The Wilmington , Mass. , garment service company also boosted its quarterly dividend 20 % to three cents a %% share %% adjusted for the split . The dividend had been five cents a share . The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. 3 to stock of record Nov. 16 , the company said .
share.n | 2 | The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about 10.2 million . Separately , UniFirst reported that net income rose 21 % to $ 3 million , or 29 cents a share adjusted for the split , for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 26 . A year earlier UniFirst earned $ 2.4 million , or 24 cents a %% share %% adjusted for the split . Sales rose to $ 52.4 million from $ 50.1 million .
share.n | 2 | Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ 39.125 , up 12.5 cents . Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year . For the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents a %% share %% , including a one-time gain of $ 5.9 million . In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ 42.9 million , or 93 cents a share . Yesterday , Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company , Brauerei Eichof Ltd .
share.n | 2 | Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder . Giovanni Agnelli , a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat 's Agnelli family , owns approximately 75 % of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale , which in turn owns approximately 40 % of Fiat , Italy 's biggest private-sector industrial group . The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary %% shares %% in the limited partnership , which will give her control of 4.67 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co . The Aga Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for 7.45 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital . His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies .
share.n | 2 | For instance , Ifint earlier this year bought an 18 % stake in Alisarda , the Aga Khan 's airline , which flies between Italy and Sardinia . Giovanni Agnelli & Co. , which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the Agnellis ' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an ever-growing family tree , has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late . It raised financing of 300 billion lire for the purchase this summer by another Agnelli-related group of the food concern Galbani S.p . A. , by selling a chunk of its IFI %% shares %% to Mediobanca S.p . A. Mediobanca said during the weekend that it agreed to sell the shares back to Giovanni Agnelli for 333 billion lire .
share.n | 1 | That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. . And combining Fraser & Neave 's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the %% share %% of the soda market there , Coke said . Fraser & Neave , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei , where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in Singapore . Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets .
share.n | 2 | The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which declined 5.16 on Monday , was up 16.05 , or 0.60 % , at 2692.65 on Tuesday . The Second Section index , which fell 21.44 points Monday , was up 6.84 points , or 0.19 % , to close at 3642.90 . Second Section volume was estimated at 14 million %% shares %% , unchanged from Monday . Institutional investors mostly remained on the sidelines Tuesday . A fund manager at a life-insurance company said three factors make it difficult to read market direction .
share.n | 2 | At the close , the narrower 30-share index was up 19.7 points to 1721.4 . Volume totaled a modest 334.5 million shares , up from 257.8 million shares Monday . The market also moved at early afternoon on news that Jaguar %% shares %% were being temporarily suspended at 746 pence ( $ 11.80 ) each . Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar , the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor . The golden share dates from Jaguar 's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover .
share.n | 2 | The golden share dates from Jaguar 's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover . The golden share was scheduled to expire at the beginning of But although the golden %% share %% has been waived , a hostile bidder for Jaguar would still have to alter the British concern 's articles of association which ban shareholdings of more than 15 % . Jaguar shares closed at 869 pence , up 122 pence , on hefty turnover of 9.7 million shares . As the London trading session drew to a close , the market was still listening to the parliamentary debate on the economy , with new Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major expected to clarify his approach to the British economy and currency issues .
share.n | 2 | Contributing to the market 's reserved stance was the release later in the day of new data on the health of the U.S. economy , in the form of the U.S. index of leading indicators . Additionally , the end of the month position-squaring might have also played a minor role , traders said . Elsewhere , %% share %% prices closed higher in Amsterdam , Brussels , Milan and Paris . Prices were mixed in Zurich and lower in Stockholm . Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong , Manila , Singapore , Sydney and Wellington , but were lower in Seoul .
share.n | 2 | In a surprise move , the British government cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker . Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree . The golden %% share %% restricts any individual holding to 15 % and expires at the end of 1990 . It was in Jaguar 's best interests `` for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , '' Mr. Ridley said . Mr. Ridley 's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker .
share.n | 2 | Jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange . In late trading , the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ( $ 1.93 ) -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares . In the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar %% shares %% trading as American Depositary Receipts closed at $ 13.625 , up $ 1.75 . Analysts expect Ford will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about 900 pence ( $ 14.25 ) a share . Such a proposal values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.53 billion ) .
share.n | 2 | The statement emphasized that holders representing 75 % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions . Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar %% shares %% that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting .
share.n | 2 | Indeed , the government is taking a calculated risk . Mr. Ridley 's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition Labor Party , who accused the Thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company . The British government retained the single golden %% share %% after selling its stake in Jaguar in The Conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expected in late 1991 . `` It 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with , '' observed Daniel Jones , professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales .
share.n | 2 | Liberty National Bancorp said its acquisition of Florence Deposit Bank , Florence , Ky. , first announced in April , has been completed in a transaction valued at $ 13.1 million . Liberty National exchanged about 78.64 shares of its common stock for each of Florence Deposit 's 5,600 %% shares %% outstanding . Liberty National , a bank holding company , has assets exceeding $ 3 billion .
share.n | 2 | `` The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka , Ill. , in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17 . `` Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal . '' Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' %% shares %% within about a month after the transaction . But about 25 % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late . The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes .
share.n | 2 | %% Shares %% closed sharply higher in London in the year 's thinnest volume Monday , supported largely by a technical bounce after last week 's sharp declines . Tokyo stocks posted a second-consecutive loss Monday , while trading in Frankfurt , West Germany , was mixed . In London , the Financial Times 100-share index finished 30.1 points higher at 2112.2 .
share.n | 2 | The market is keenly interested in hearing what he has to say about the status of the current 15 % base lending rate . In London trading , Courtaulds , a chemicals and textiles company , increased 15 pence to 362 after it disclosed plans to spin off its textiles operations into a separately listed company on Jan. 1 . It was the most active of the 100-share index at 8.3 million %% shares %% , 6.5 million of which were traded by midday . Jaguar ended 22 higher at 747 . Dealers said fresh buying was drawn into Jaguar after a senior executive of Daimler-Benz , the auto maker , told a British television interviewer during the weekend that the West German company held talks with the luxury auto maker over possible joint ventures .
share.n | 2 | Declining issues outnumbered advancers 551 to 349 ; 224 issues were unchanged . Investors , who took profits Friday , mostly took a wait-and-see attitude Monday amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and New York stocks , traders said . Takamori Matsuda , an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities , said fading expectation for lower interest rates made investors step back from real-estate %% shares %% , which advanced last week . Some traders said institutions were waiting to see the U.S. jobless rate to be issued Friday . The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section , which fell 15.82 points Friday , was down 5.16 points , or 0.19 % , at 2676.60 .
share.n | 2 | The energy of participating investors streamed into Tokyu Group shares , pushing prices of its companies up across the board . Tokyu Group announced during the weekend that each Group company will buy the others ' stocks to defend themselves against a rumored takeover . The announcement fueled speculation for future advances in the %% shares %% . Tokyu Department Store advanced 260 to 2410 . Tokyu Corp. was up 150 at 2890 .
share.n | 2 | Richard Rifenburgh , chairman and chief executive of the Longmont , Colo. , disk-drive maker , also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year . Mr. Rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving `` aggressively '' to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits , but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail . Mr. Rifenburgh also noted that 150 million %% shares %% of MiniScribe common stock were traded during the past three years , `` so there 's a tremendous amount of exposure . '' MiniScribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income . MiniScribe also has n't filed any financial statements for 1989 .
share.n | 2 | Rally 's Inc. said it adopted a shareholders rights plan to protect shareholders from an inadequately priced takeover offer . The plan provides for the distribution of one common stock-purchase right as a dividend for each %% share %% of common outstanding . Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-half share of common for $ 30 . Earlier this month , a group led by three of the company 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II , indicated it had a 45.2 % stake in the Louisville , Ky. , fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
share.n | 2 | An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified by accounting adjustments and that the company 's loss was smaller on a cash basis . Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S. , Canada , Brazil , Italy and Taiwan . In a related development , Avery said it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers , Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May , surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery 's common %% shares %% . On a fully diluted basis , the two raised their stake to 68 % from 51 % . In December 1988 , Messrs. Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc. , a packaging company they controlled , to Pechiney Corp. of France .
share.n | 2 | Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the Big Board 's factions . But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading . Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many companies that have %% shares %% listed on the Big Board . Mr. Phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just `` how the world is . If bringing the message is a crime , I 'm guilty of it . ''

Ogden Projects , which has interests in solid-waste recovery and hazardous-waste cleanup , said it has 13 facilities in operation , up from seven a year ago . Meanwhile , Ogden Corp. , which also has interests in building maintenance and management , reported third-quarter net income of $ 27.1 million , or 67 cents a %% share %% , more than twice the $ 13.5 million , or 34 cents a share , a year earlier .

The company , which currently has 13.5 million common %% shares %% outstanding , said it has no specific plans for the shares .
share.n | 2 | Aside from the takeover news , big buy orders were placed for blue-chip shares in afternoon trading . Traders said the buy programs came from very large institutional accounts that were also active in the stock-index futures markets . At one point , almost all of the %% shares %% in the 20-stock Major Market Index , which mimics the industrial average , were sharply higher . Some 1,111 Big Board issues advanced in price and only 448 declined , while broader market averages rose sharply . Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index climbed 5.29 to 340.36 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 4.70 to 318.79 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 2.65 to
share.n | 2 | But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market 's surge , as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session . Georgia-Pacific fell 2 1\/2 to 50 7\/8 , but most paper and forest-products stocks firmed as market players speculated about other potential industry takeover targets . Within the paper sector , Mead climbed 2 3\/8 to 38 3\/4 on 1.3 million %% shares %% , Union Camp rose 2 3\/4 to 37 3\/4 , Federal Paper Board added 1 3\/4 to 23 7\/8 , Bowater gained 1 1\/2 to 27 1\/2 , Stone Container rose 1 to 26 1\/8 and Temple-Inland jumped 3 3\/4 to 62 1\/4 .

The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.71 to 370.58 . Volume totaled 11,820,000 %% shares %% . Imperial Holly fell 1 5\/8 to 27 1\/8 in the wake of its third-quarter earnings report .

share.n | 2 | Earlier yesterday , the Societe de Bourses Francaises was told that a unit of Framatome S.A. also bought Navigation Mixte shares , this purchase covering more than 160,000 shares . Both companies are allies of Navigation Mixte in its fight against a hostile takeover bid launched last week by Cie . Financiere de Paribas at 1,850 French francs ( $ 297 ) a %% share %% . Navigation Mixte 's chairman had suggested that friendly institutions were likely to buy its stock as soon as trading opened Monday . The Credit Lyonnais purchase , for 33,000 regular common shares and 10,000 newly created shares , is valued at about slightly more than 80 million French francs .
share.n | 2 | But Asher B. Edelman , who controls about 16 % of the San Antonio , Texas , computer-servicing company , insisted that the announcement did n't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp . Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint . Intelogic holds 27.5 % of Datapoint 's common %% shares %% outstanding . Mr. Edelman said the decision `` has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman . '' Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of Datapoint .
share.n | 2 | Santa Fe also has $ 3.7 billion in debt . In addition , its railroad lost a $ 750 million antitrust suit , which is on appeal , and which analysts say could be settled for one-third that amount . That nets out to about $ 17 a %% share %% for the company on a private market basis . But Santa Fe , currently trading at 18 7\/8 , is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would be onerous . Its plan , instead , is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets .

share.n | 2 | `` They are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits , because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks , '' said Robin West , director of research for Ladenburg Thalmann 's Lanyi division , which specializes in emerging growth stocks . The technology group includes many of the OTC market 's biggest stocks , which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index . Analysts say rallies in the group historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted %% share %% prices broadly . But increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings . The stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows .
share.n | 2 | Coast Savings Financial Inc. reported a third-quarter loss , citing a previously announced capital restructuring program . The Los Angeles thrift holding company said it had a loss of $ 92.2 million , or $ 6.98 a share , for the quarter ended Sept. 30 . Coast earned $ 10.2 million , or 67 cents a %% share %% , in the year-ago quarter . The year-ago results have been restated to comply with government regulations . The restructuring program is designed to increase the company 's tangible capital ratio .
share.n | 2 | Long-term bond prices rose despite trepidation about what a key economic report will show today . Analysts said the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for the past three weeks in the wake of the collapsed UAL Corp . buy-out . Great Northern Nekoosa soared $ 20.125 a share , to $ 62.875 , substantially above the $ 58 a %% share %% Georgia-Pacific is offering . That indicates speculators are betting a higher offer is in the wings . Prices of other paper makers rose sharply , although Georgia-Pacific fell $ 2.50 a share , to $ 50.875 .
share.n | 2 | However , StatesWest is n't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger Mesa . StatesWest , which has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , said it may purchase more Mesa stock or make a tender offer directly to Mesa shareholders . StatesWest had proposed acquiring Mesa for $ 7 a share and one %% share %% of a new series of StatesWest 6 % convertible preferred stock it values at $ 3 a share . Earlier , Mesa had rejected a general proposal from StatesWest to combine the two carriers in some way . StatesWest serves 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada .

On Wall Street , takeover stock traders bid Nekoosa 's stock well above the Georgia-Pacific bid , assuming that Nekoosa 's will either be sold to a rival bidder or to Georgia-Pacific at a higher price -- as much as $ 75 a share , according to some estimates . Yesterday , Nekoosa common closed in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $ 62.875 , up $ 20.125 , on volume of almost 6.3 million %% shares %% . Georgia-Pacific closed down $ 2.50 , at $ 50.875 in Big Board trading . Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray , Georgia-Pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed : namely , industrial companies can continue bidding for one another , but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing .
share.n | 2 | First Security Corp. said it tentatively agreed to acquire Deseret Bancorp. for stock valued at about $ 18 million . Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for each Deseret share held , or a total of about 550,000 First Security %% shares %% . It has about 12.3 million shares outstanding . Deseret , with about $ 100 million in assets , is the parent of the Deseret Bank , which has six offices and headquarters at Pleasant Grove , Utah .
share.n | 2 | Ocean Drilling said it will offer 15 % to 20 % of the contract-drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future . It has long been rumored that Ocean Drilling would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business . Ocean Drilling said it wo n't hold any %% shares %% of the new company after the restructuring .
share.n | 2 | The company , which has 13.8 million common shares outstanding , said in mid-June that it was considering a restructuring to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns . In late May , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC , launched a $ 50-a-share , or $ 777 million , tender offer for the Hamilton , Bermuda-based Sea Containers . In mid-August , the companies , through their jointly owned holding company , Temple Holdings Ltd. , sweetened the offer to $ 63 a %% share %% , or $ 963 million . Officials for Temple declined to comment . News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers ' shares up $ 1 to $ 62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
share.n | 2 | Michael Carstens , an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day , added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses . For holders who decide not to tender their shares , Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $ 25 , plus a cash dividend on the common stock . The company said its directors , management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and wo n't tender any of their %% shares %% under the offer . Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares . That injunction resulted from litigation between Temple and Sea Containers last May .
share.n | 2 | Interface Systems Inc. , Ann Arbor , Mich. , said it will report net income for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 470,000 , or 11 cents a share , from $ 805,000 , or 19 cents a %% share %% , a year earlier . Chairman Carl L. Bixby said the decline occurred although revenue rose 30 % to more than $ 8.3 million from $ 6.4 million a year earlier . The company , which makes computer parts said fiscal 1989 earnings were `` down slightly '' from $ 3.2 million , or 74 cents a share , in fiscal l988 .
share.n | 2 | Cray 's directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company , to be called Cray Computer Corp . It will trade over the counter under the symbol CRAY . The plan calls for Cray Research holders to receive one share in the new company for every two %% shares %% held . An estimated 14.7 million Cray Computer shares will be distributed , Cray Research said . Under the accord , Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray 's fledgling operation $ 53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend Cray Computer $ 98.6 million .
share.n | 2 | Fluor , based in Irvine , Calif. , will direct expansion of the mine 's capacity to 52,000 metric tons a day from 32,000 metric tons a day . Completion of the project is expected by mid-1992 . In 1988 , Fluor had revenue of $ 5.1 billion and earnings of $ 56.4 million , or 71 cents a %% share %% .
share.n | 2 | Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc. , New York , likely will reject a renewed offer from Florida investor Robert I. Green to buy Bancroft for $ 18.95 a %% share %% . Sigmund Levine , Bancroft secretary and treasurer , said the closed-end fund 's directors will consider Mr. Green 's offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting . `` He has n't added anything , '' Mr. Levine said , predicting the board will again reject Mr. Green 's proposal .
share.n | 2 | Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice president . As of Sept. 30 , Mercury 's assets were $ 2.25 billion , down from $ 2.62 billion a year ago . For the nine months , Mercury posted a loss of $ 5.4 million , or 86 cents %% share %% , against net income of $ 4 million , or 63 cents share , a year earlier . Mercury shares closed yesterday at $ 4.625 , up 50 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
share.n | 2 | While Allianz officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans , they said Allianz currently holds between 5 % and 10 % of Navigation Mixte , an apparent increase from the 5 % stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced . Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning , and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ( $ 17.19 ) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading . It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday , when Paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte %% share %% . Allianz also holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance subsidiary , one of France 's largest insurance groups , which it bought for about 6.5 billion francs just before Paribas launched its bid . Navigation Mixte holds the remaining 50 % .
share.n | 2 | Allianz did n't say whom , if anyone , it will support . It said simply that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself , as long as it has French regulatory officials ' approval . Paribas currently intends to offer 1,850 francs a %% share %% for Navigation Mixte shares that receive full dividends this year . It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1 , which receive partial dividends . Alternatively , it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share .

It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1 , which receive partial dividends . Alternatively , it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte %% share %% . Paribas already holds about 18.7 % of Navigation Mixte , and the acquisition of the additional 48 % would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid . The bid values Navigation Mixte at around 23 billion francs , depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires .
share.n | 2 | Doug Hammond , the federal mediator in Seattle , where Boeing is based , said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again . Despite the progress , Boeing indicated that the work stoppage , now in its 27th day , will have `` a serious adverse impact '' on the current quarter . For the third quarter , net rose to $ 242 million , or $ 1.05 a share , from $ 144 million , or 63 cents a %% share %% . Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .
share.n | 1 | Quebecor will own 57.5 % of the new subsidiary . Caisse de Depot et Placement , the Quebec government pension-fund agency , will pay $ 112.5 million for the remaining 22.5 % stake in the printing operation . Pierre-Karl Peladeau , the founder 's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition , says Quebecor has n't decided how it will finance its %% share %% of the purchase , but he says it most likely will use debt . The Maxwell deal is Quebecor 's second big printing acquisition in just over a year . Last October , Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc. , a Montreal telecommunications , manufacturing , energy and real estate company .
share.n | 2 | ( The company did n't put out a public announcement . A spokesman said later that Mr. Olson was being `` conservative '' in his estimate . But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year 's $ 1.20 a %% share %% , it thinks Street estimates of $ 1 or so are low . ) Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co. , Minneapolis , calls himself `` the last remaining bull on the stock . '' He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood : `` This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed , like finding a white rhino . ''
share.n | 2 | Daimler said it has had talks with Jaguar about possible joint ventures . Meanwhile , General Motors and Ford Motor continue their pursuit of the company . Ford has acquired more than 13 % of Jaguar 's %% shares %% , and GM has received U.S. regulatory clearance to buy 15 % . ShowBiz Pizza Time gained 1 1\/2 to 13 . The company reported third-quarter operating profit of 37 cents a share , compared with 12 cents a share a year earlier .
share.n | 2 | Under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed . But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined . Each company 's %% share %% of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension .
share.n | 2 | But yesterday , Mr. Carpenter said big institutional investors , which he would n't identify , `` told us they would n't do business with firms '' that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts . `` We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions , '' he said . Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million %% shares %% in index-arbitrage trading , and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading , which includes index arbitrage . Most of Kidder 's program trading is for its own account , according to the New York Stock Exchange . Kidder denied that GE 's chairman and chief executive , John F. Welch , had anything to do with Kidder 's decision .
share.n | 1 | Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year . Lotus Development Corp. has slashed the lag between U.S. and Japan product introductions to six months from three years . Ungermann-Bass Inc. has a bigger %% share %% of the computer-network market in Japan than at home . But the Japanese have to go a long way to catch up . Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry .
share.n | 2 | Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy . Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies , the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered British pound , which gained slightly against the dollar . Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange dwindled to only 126.6 million %% shares %% yesterday as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading . Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account , and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients . Yet that did n't eliminate program trading from the market .
share.n | 2 | Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes . The forest-products concern currently has about 38 million shares outstanding . In yesterday 's composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Louisiana-Pacific %% shares %% closed at $ 39.25 , down 37.5 cents .
share.n | 2 | Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware 's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here , but he made no comment and asked no questions . He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer . Dow Jones has offered to pay $ 18 a %% share %% , or about $ 576 million , for the remaining Telerate stake . The offer will expire at 5 p.m. EST on Nov. 6 , unless extended again . Robert Kornreich , an attorney for the Telerate holders , told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is `` arrogant '' and `` hostile . ''
share.n | 2 | The agreement is said to be similar to Warner 's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen , whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit . Although Mr. Azoff wo n't produce films at first , it is possible that he could do so later , the sources said . Like Mr. Geffen 's arrangement , the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world 's largest and most successful record distributor ; in the U.S. alone , Warner has a 40 % %% share %% of the market , about double its nearest competitor , Sony Corp. 's CBS Records . For Warner , meanwhile , it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business . The 41-year-old Mr. Azoff , a former rock 'n' roll manager , is credited with turning around MCA 's once-moribund music division in his six years at the company .
share.n | 2 | Chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs . That arrangement apparently has worked well , and Thomas A. Bologna , president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe , founded in 1983 , said the sale of the company means `` we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing . '' Chugai agreed to pay $ 6.25 a share for Gen-Probe 's 17.6 million common %% shares %% outstanding on a fully diluted basis . Yesterday , in national trading in the over-the-counter market , Gen-Probe common closed at $ 3.25 a share . Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition .
share.n | 2 | Rymer Foods Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 of its common stock purchase warrants at a price of $ 4 a warrant . The food company , which has 720,000 warrants and about 2.9 million common shares outstanding , said it may increase the offer to purchase any or all warrants that are properly tendered . A warrant permits a holder to acquire one %% share %% of common stock for $ 17.50 a share . The warrants expire on Oct. 15 , 1992 , and may be called by the company at a price of $ 5.25 . The offer is scheduled to expire on Nov. 28 , unless extended .
share.n | 2 | WHEN HUSBANDS take on more housework , they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife . Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18 . The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate %% share %% each did . Not unexpectedly , wives , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two-thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child care and family paper work . Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half .
share.n | 2 | London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down . London %% shares %% were depressed initially by overnight losses in New York and by the drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation . It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling , but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading , and signs of further weakness in the British pound , proved a hefty load to bear . New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed .
share.n | 2 | He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization . British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence ( $ 2.90 ) . Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London %% shares %% will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor , John Major , had only been in the job one day . Besides British Gas , British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares . British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded .
share.n | 2 | In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44 . On Friday , the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76 . First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion %% shares %% , up from 886 million shares Thursday . An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday . Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions .
share.n | 2 | Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week . That 's leaving small investors with cold feet , they said , and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat . Elsewhere , %% share %% prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Amsterdam , Brussels and Stockholm , and were mixed in Milan . The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines . Share prices also closed lower in Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Manila , Wellington and Seoul .
share.n | 2 | And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further , market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress . On days when prices are tumbling , they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will . In such an environment , market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of %% shares %% . `` It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose , '' says Mr. Antolini , of Donaldson Lufkin . But this skittishness , Mr. Antolini says , is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks .
share.n | 2 | Friday 's trading volume totaled 132.8 million shares . The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares . LIN Broadcasting surged 4 5\/8 to 112 5\/8 ; LIN and BellSouth sweetened their merger agreement in an attempt to keep shareholders from tendering their %% shares %% to McCaw Cellular Communications . McCaw , which dropped 2 1\/2 to 37 3\/4 , has offered $ 125 a share for a majority of LIN 's shares . The revised LIN-BellSouth agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders .
share.n | 2 | Starpointe Savings Bank rose 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Dime Savings Bank of New York 's $ 21-a-share acquisition of Starpointe . Kirschner Medical fell 4 to 15 . The company said its third-quarter earnings will probably be lower than the 16 cents a %% share %% it reported last year , despite a rise in the company 's revenue . Kirschner earned $ 376,000 on revenue of $ 14.5 million in the 1988 quarter . The company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline , including softer sales of joint-implants .
share.n | 2 | Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt , he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later . Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share . They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a %% share %% . The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share . McCaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S. , already owns about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock .
share.n | 2 | McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause . Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices . To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a %% share %% , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer . `` We 're very pleased with the new deal . We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , which holds 500,000 LIN shares .
share.n | 2 | But Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares . `` How many shares will be around in 1995 ? '' he asked . `` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up %% shares %% in the meanwhile . '' BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . William O. McCoy , president of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter .
share.n | 2 | Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share , or $ 1.9 billion , but now those estimates are being scaled back . In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $ 52.125 . In national over-the-counter trading , LIN %% shares %% soared $ 4.625 to closed at $ 112.625 , while McCaw fell $ 2.50 a share to $ 37.75 . The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company , including the newly acquired Metromedia stake , would give the new entity 55 million potential customers , including about 35 million in the nation 's top 10 markets . Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984 .
share.n | 2 | Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a %% share %% from 2.5 cents on common , and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock , payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6 . The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad , Inc. , which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc . For the 10-month fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , Chairman Eli Broad said he expected earnings results to approximate analysts ' estimates , which the company said have been revised upward to 80 cents a share .
share.n | 2 | The European Community Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small-screen color-television sets . Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers ' profits and led to job losses , the commission imposed a duty of 10.2 % on TVs made by Daewoo , a duty of 12.3 % on Goldstar Co. , 13 % on Samsung and 19.6 % on TVs made by other South Korean producers . The commission said that EC television producers lost `` important market %% shares %% '' and suffered an `` unsustainable '' pressure on prices because of the Korean companies ' marketing and pricing policies , which it said were `` in clear violation '' of international trade rules . In other news concerning South Korea 's television industry , Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz , the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union , to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union . South Korea and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year .
share.n | 2 | Crane officials did n't return phone calls seeking comment . Crane holds 504,200 Milton Roy shares , including 254,200 bought from Sept. 14 to Thursday for $ 15.50 to $ 16.75 each . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Milton Roy shares leaped $ 2 , to $ 18.375 each , while Crane sank $ 1.125 , to $ 21.125 a %% share %% . John M. McNamara , chief financial officer of Milton Roy , said the company has no comment on Crane 's filing . Milton Roy recently fended off unsolicited overtures from Thermo Electron Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of biomedical products .
share.n | 2 | Securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year . Some had predicted earnings of more than $ 4 a share for this year , up from last year 's fully diluted $ 3.27 a share on earnings of $ 680.6 million . But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a %% share %% fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion . And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter . So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2 a share from $ 3 .
share.n | 2 | Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London , where he was working as a financial consultant , he learned that a large packet of Bally 's shares was up for sale . Looking into Bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs ; it had 7,000 employees . Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife , Mr. Rey acquired 20 % of Bally 's %% shares %% . But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976 , and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain . Eventually , Mr. Rey was forced to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys ' network .
share.n | 2 | Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million , or $ 1.63 a %% share %% , reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions . Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million , including $ 36 million from Hugo . Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
share.n | 2 | RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A. 's Nestle Foods unit for $ 370 million . The sale , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle 's 7 % %% share %% of the U.S. candy market to about 12 % . The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December . The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers .
share.n | 2 | Waxman Industries Inc. said holders of $ 6,542,000 face amount of its 6 1\/4 % convertible subordinated debentures , due March 15 , 2007 , have elected to convert the debt into about 683,000 common %% shares %% . The conversion price is $ 9.58 a share . The company said the holders represent 52 % of the face amount of the debentures .
share.n | 2 | Air & Water , which provides environmental services and systems , paid about 1.4 million of its shares for Falcon . In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Air & Water closed unchanged at $ 17.50 . At July 31 , Air & Water had nearly 10 million %% shares %% outstanding .
share.n | 2 | Automatic Data Processing Inc. plans to redeem on Nov. 16 its $ 150 million of 6.5 % convertible subordinated debentures due March 1 , 2011 . The computing-services concern will pay $ 1,059.04 for each $ 1,000 face amount of debt . The conversion price for the debentures is $ 41.725 a %% share %% . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Automatic Data closed at $ 46.50 a share , down $ 2.25 . If all the debt is converted to common , Automatic Data will issue about 3.6 million shares ; last Monday , the company had nearly 73 million shares outstanding .

The insurance concern said all conversion rights on the stock will terminate on Nov. 30 . Until then , Conseco said the stock remains convertible into common stock at the rate of 1.439 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock , which is equivalent to a conversion price of $ 17.50 a common share .

share.n | 2 | Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew , the sources said . Last Friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic .

share.n | 2 | To switch to another vendor 's chips , `` would definitely not be an option , '' he said . Nonetheless , concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel 's stock to $ 32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq 's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday .

The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices .

'' The government retained the single %% share %% after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization .

In the latest nine months , Ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a %% share %% , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a share .

share.n | 2 | A spokesman for McCaw said the company was `` moving forward with our financing . '' He added that `` hopefully LIN will conduct a fair auction . '' McCaw wants to buy 22 million %% shares %% of LIN for $ 125 each , or $ 2.75 billion , which would result in McCaw 's owning 50.3 % of LIN . The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp . In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , LIN rose 50 cents , to $ 109.25 .
share.n | 2 | AVON RENT-A-CAR & TRUCK Corp. said it declared a dividend of one warrant for each three shares of common stock .

share.n | 2 | Amdahl Corp. , a maker of mainframe computers , reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter , citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong U.S. dollar . Net income fell 37 % to $ 32.9 million , or 30 cents a share , from $ 52.2 million , or 48 cents a %% share %% , in the year-ago period . Revenue rose 15 % to $ 534.3 million from $ 464.7 million . Amdahl 's results were somewhat worse than expected .
share.n | 1 | Similarly , Honda Motor Co. 's sales are so brisk that workers grumble they have n't had a Saturday off in years , despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity . With demand growing and workers in short supply , many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation . Among them are the shipbuilders , which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased %% share %% of the strengthening global market . Sasebo Heavy Industries Co. , a medium-sized shipbuilder , expects its sales to increase 30 % this year , largely because of rising demand for oil tankers . Once one Japanese company steps up its investments , the whole industry follows .
share.n | 2 | But we ca n't produce enough anymore . '' The competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market . Nissan aims to expand its 25 % %% share %% of the market to 30 % by spending $ 141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year . Meanwhile , Toyota Motor Corp. 's $ 247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars , and Honda is spending $ 317 million on expansion . Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years .
share.n | 2 | The company also posted third-quarter earnings that were in line with analysts ' forecasts . Blue-chip consumer stocks also provided a lift to the industrial average .

The board is n't aware of any attempts to take over Philip Morris , the company said . As of Sept. 30 , Philip Morris had 926 million shares outstanding .
share.n | 2 | American Medical International Inc. said it has n't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals , and took another step toward completion of its $ 3 billion acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp . Earlier this month IMA , an investment group that includes Chicago 's Pritzker family and First Boston Corp. , submitted a reduced bid for American Medical after it could n't finance its initial offer .

share.n | 2 | Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson , which makes steel roofs , store fronts and building parts , declined comment . As reported last month , Mr. Kass said he was interested in making an offer to buy H.H. Robertson for $ 13 a share . In the SEC filing , the Kass-Pedone group said it intends to acquire additional H.H. Robertson %% shares %% `` with a view towards a possible change in control of the company . '' It has not , however , made a formal proposal . The group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares , but no agreements have yet been reached , the filing said .

Its stake includes 106,100 %% shares %% bought in the open market from Aug. 30 to Oct. 18 for $ 10.375 to $ 12.125 a share . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , H.H. Robertson closed at $ 11.625 , up 62.5 cents .

Revenue in the latest quarter fell 17 % to $ 44 million from $ 53.2 million , the company said , reflecting poor utilization of the company 's facilities and its behavioral medicine contracts .
share.n | 2 | But losers were spread in a broad range by the end of the session . A trader said that the more an issue gained recently , the sharper the loss sustained Wednesday . A trader at Yamaichi Securities said the market 's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone %% shares %% , which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year . NTT lost 30,000 yen to 1,380,000 yen ( $ 9,756 ) . Some traders noted individual investors dumped NTT shares amid growing expectation for a division of the company as suggested by a recent government-sponsored panel .
share.n | 2 | The Financial Times 100-share index finished at 2161.9 , up 12.6 points . The 30-share index ended 12.6 points higher at 1751.9 . Volume was thin at 374.6 million %% shares %% traded , down from 405.4 million Tuesday . Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market 's recent downtrend . Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise , dealers said London dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the market-makers .
share.n | 2 | Other banks were slightly more resilient , with Dresdner Bank shedding 4.8 to 320 , and Commerzbank slipping 2.5 to Meanwhile , Wall Street 's volatility unnerved investors in other markets . %% Share %% prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Brussels , Milan and Stockholm , and mixed in Amsterdam . Among Pacific markets , prices closed lower in Sydney , Seoul , Hong Kong , Manila , Singapore and Wellington . Trading in Taipei was suspended for a national holiday .
share.n | 2 | The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $ 4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . The stock closed at $ 38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares . %% Shares %% of Coors , the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor , fell $ 1.50 apiece to $ 19.125 in national over-the-counter trading , apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle . Anheuser noted that `` beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s , with sales volume being essentially flat '' while consolidation creates fewer , bigger players . `` We can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend , '' Anheuser said , adding it will take `` appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy '' for the premium brands .
share.n | 2 | Mr. Thompson calls discounting `` a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , '' and projected that Anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle . Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings , which fell five cents a share short of his own projections , contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public . But Smith Barney 's Mr. Doyle , who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $ 2.95 a %% share %% from $ 3.10 , called the market 's reaction `` justified . '' While the third-quarter earnings were a `` moderate disappointment , '' he said , `` the real bad news is the intensity of price competition '' in the premium-beer sector . According to Mr. Steinman , the newsletter publisher , Anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor , Miller Brewing , which had a 21.2 % stake last year .
share.n | 2 | Columbia Savings & Loan Association , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market , announced a loss for the third quarter of $ 226.3 million , or $ 11.57 a share . For the quarter a year ago , Columbia reported earnings of $ 16.3 million , or 37 cents a %% share %% . Total assets increased to $ 12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $ 12.4 billion a year earlier . The loss stems from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio , which includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk bonds , $ 400 million of preferred stock , and Treasury securities .
share.n | 2 | Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market . Its shares closed at $ 5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading , down 37.5 cents . The price of Columbia %% shares %% has been cut nearly in half since August , when they traded at about $ 10 , as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down . The stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a share on Oct. 9 . Columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk bonds , because federal regulations , such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries , have n't yet been completed .
share.n | 2 | For the quarter ended Sept. 30 , Delta posted net income of $ 133.1 million , or $ 2.53 a share , up from $ 100 million , or $ 2.03 a share , a year earlier . Revenue rose 15 % to $ 2.17 billion from $ 1.89 billion . During the quarter , Delta issued 2.5 million %% shares %% of common stock to Swissair , and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan . `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % .

For the nine months , America West posted earnings of $ 18.9 million , or 97 cents a %% share %% , compared with a loss of $ 9.7 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier . Revenue rose 27 % to $ 715.1 million from $ 563.8 million .
share.n | 2 | Lawrence Insurance also sold 3.2 million of its shares for $ 7.125 each to its parent , Lawrence Group Inc . Lawrence Insurance , based in Albany , N.Y. , plans to use the $ 22.5 million in proceeds to help finance the acquisition of United Republic . By acquiring the %% shares %% , Lawrence Group increased its stake in Lawrence Insurance to 93.2 % from 91.2 % . Lawrence Insurance underwrites mostly primary insurance , a company spokesman said . A reinsurance company effectively insures insurance companies that wish to spread the risk of a particular policy .
share.n | 2 | Bethlehem , the nation 's second largest steelmaker , earned $ 46.9 million , or 54 cents a share . The figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations . In the year-ago period , Bethlehem earned $ 101.4 million , or $ 1.27 a %% share %% , including a $ 3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt . Third-quarter sales dropped 11 % to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year ago . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $ 17.375 .
share.n | 2 | `` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories , '' said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams . He noted , however , that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations . Armco , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 39 cents a %% share %% in the year-ago quarter . Sales dropped to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million , because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division , which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp . Along with reduced volume , analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped .
share.n | 2 | European Investment Bank ( agency ) -- $ 150 million of 8 1\/2 % bonds due Nov. 22 , 1999 , priced at 99.75 to yield 8.54 % at reoffered price , via lead manager JP Morgan Securities Ltd .

share.n | 2 | The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned . Mr. Icahn has long believed , associates say , that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled $ 16.88 billion , is worth $ 70 a share if broken up . The stock closed yesterday at $ 33.625 , giving Mr. Icahn 's 33.6 million %% shares %% a value of $ 1.13 billion . Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say .
share.n | 2 | In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Homestake closed at $ 15.25 , down 25 cents . `` A significant increase in gold sales to 248,279 ounces for the quarter from 188,726 in the third quarter of 1988 was more than offset by the continued decline in average gold price realization to $ 367 from $ 429 per ounce , '' the company said . For the nine months , the mining company posted a 40 % drop in profit to $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , from $ 50.6 million , or 52 cents a %% share %% , on a 6 % rise in revenue to $ 323.2 million from $ 305.7 million .
share.n | 2 | Shortly before that , USAir had said its third-quarter results would be `` significantly lower '' than a year earlier . Yesterday , it provided the details : Its loss of $ 77.7 million , or $ 1.86 a %% share %% , contrasted with net of $ 68.5 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the 1988 third quarter . Revenue rose only 3.3 % in the latest period , to $ 1.53 billion from $ 1.48 billion . For the nine months , the Arlington , Va. , company 's net plunged 73 % to $ 38.5 million , or 76 cents a share , from $ 142.2 million , or $ 3.28 a share .
share.n | 2 | Revenue rose 12 % to $ 4.75 billion from $ 4.22 billion . The results surprised many analysts , because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines . Shortly after announcing its quarterly loss , USAir 's stock tumbled $ 3 a %% share %% . It ended at $ 40.125 , down $ 2.375 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . `` Nobody was expecting this size of a loss , '' said Paul Karos , an analyst with First Boston Corp .
share.n | 2 | London %% share %% prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the back of Wall Street 's steep drop and renewed fears over U.K. economic fundamentals . Tokyo 's winning streak came to an end , and stocks fell in Frankfurt and across Europe as well . London 's Financial Times 100-share index shed 40.4 points to finish at 2149.3 .
share.n | 2 | On the life insurance side , Pearl Group finished 5 lower at 640 , and Sun Life dropped 15 to # 11.53 . Jaguar finished 4 lower at 694 . Dealers said the market did n't react substantially to Ford Motor Co. 's disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will seek 100 % of Jaguar 's shares outstanding when U.K. government %% share %% regulations are lifted at the end of next year . Tokyo stocks closed easier , posting their first loss in six trading days , partly because of programmed index-linked selling by trust investment funds in the afternoon session . The Nikkei index fell 58.97 points to 35526.55 .
share.n | 2 | Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization , domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen . Investors expect these shares will be targets of investment trust funds , which often buy small amounts spread across a wide range of issues . On the other hand , high-priced %% shares %% such as Pioneer Electronic and Sony failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds , observers said . Tuesday 's notable losers were highpriced shares such as Pioneer , which shed 210 yen to 5,900 yen . Sony was down 130 to 8,590 .
share.n | 2 | Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. %% shares %% was halted on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges late yesterday afternoon at the company 's request , Toronto Stock Exchange officials said .

share.n | 2 | Knight-Ridder Inc. said third-quarter earnings jumped 18 % , partly because of the sale of two of its media properties . The media concern said net income rose to $ 37.8 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 57 cents a %% share %% , in the year-earlier period . The latest results include a gain of $ 4.2 million , or eight cents a share , on the sale of television stations in Oklahoma City and Flint , Mich .

Vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a redeemable loan note in lieu of cash . The notes can be redeemed starting in July 1991 .
share.n | 2 | `` Options traders , arbitrage traders -- everyone , '' said Mr. Bates , cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday . Added Mr. Jacobson , `` There were some pretty bad losses in the stock . '' Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $ 150 a %% share %% entered by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which was active in UAL stock all day , is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon . A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday 's close . Both Jacobson traders , who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal , read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning .
share.n | 2 | And at 9:15 , they posted a $ 135 to $ 155 `` first indication , '' or the price range in which the stock would probably open . That range was quickly narrowed to $ 145 to $ 155 , although traders surrounding the post were told that $ 148 to $ 150 would be the likely target . When UAL finally opened a half hour late , some 400,000 %% shares %% traded at $ 150 . There was `` selling pressure from everyone , '' said one trader . This month 's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by UAL news was n't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action .
share.n | 2 | HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14 % to $ 23.9 million , or $ 1.10 per fully diluted share , from $ 27.9 million , or $ 1.21 a fully diluted %% share %% , because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property . The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed 's stock , which lost 8.6 % of its value , closing at $ 38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , down $ 3.625 . HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market .
share.n | 2 | MORGAN STANLEY , THE ONCE STODGY investment house , in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover . It was the start of a boom in unfriendly , even ungentlemanly , mergers . On July 18 , 1974 , International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $ 28 a %% share %% , equal to $ 157 million , for ESB , a Philadelphia battery maker . ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from Inco , as the Toronto company is called . `` ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB 's shares , '' said F.J.

share.n | 2 | The other insiders , all senior or executive vice presidents , sold between 2,520 and 6,881 shares , representing between 8 % and 70 % of their holdings , according to SEC filings . Dun & Bradstreet 's stock price began its recent spiral downward last Wednesday , when the company reported third-quarter results . Net income rose to 83 cents a share from 72 cents a %% share %% the year-earlier period . But analysts focused more on the drop in revenue , to $ 1.04 billion from $ 1.07 billion , reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of the controversial credit-reporting services . Last Thursday , Merrill Lynch securities analyst Peter Falco downgraded his investment rating on the firm , according to Dow Jones Professional Investors Report , citing a slowdown in the credit-reporting business .
share.n | 2 | The $ 942,000 purchase raised his holdings to 74,000 shares . The stock split four-for-one on Oct. 10 . Mr. Miles 's newly purchased %% shares %% are now worth $ 1,068,000 , based on Philip Morris 's closing price of $ 44.50 , up 62.5 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday . A spokesman for Mr. Miles said he bought the shares because he felt they were `` a good investment . '' The executive made his purchases shortly before being named to his current chief executive officer 's position ; formerly he was Kraft General Foods ' chief operating officer .
share.n | 2 | John J. Crabb sold 4,500 shares for $ 11.13 each , leaving himself with a stake of 500 shares . He received $ 50,085 . Peter Kutney sold 5,000 %% shares %% , all of his holdings , for $ 11.38 a share , or $ 56,900 . Gary Straub , corporate counsel for the company , said the directors sold for `` personal financial reasons . '' Both insiders declined to comment .
share.n | 2 | In a statement , Ralph S. Larsen , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company was pleased with its third-quarter sales performance , `` especially in light of the extremely competitive environment in domestic consumer markets and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates this quarter . '' David J. Lothson , an industry analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc. , said Johnson & Johnson 's results slightly exceeded his expectations for the third quarter . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Johnson & Johnson %% shares %% fell 37.5 cents to $ 54.625 . Mr. Larsen noted `` substantial sales growth '' for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and Hismanal , a once-a-day antihistamine . Eprex , used by dialysis patients who are anemic , and Prepulsid , a gastro-intestinal drug , did well overseas , he said .

share.n | 2 | Cray said it earned $ 30.6 million , or $ 1.04 a share , up 35 % from $ 22.6 million , or 73 cents a share , a year ago . Revenue gained 45 % to $ 210.2 million from $ 145.2 million . For the nine months , earnings totaled $ 36.6 million , or $ 1.24 a %% share %% , down 46 % from $ 68.1 million , or $ 2.19 a share , a year earlier . Revenue was $ 454.6 million , a 6.9 % gain from $ 425.4 million . Cray made its announcement after the stock market closed .
share.n | 2 | There are drawbacks . Vincent Tolentino , a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama , says of the recently ended Tokyo festival : `` No one makes deals ... and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals . '' Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy %% shares %% or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs ( about $ 2.60 ) for each transaction , bringing the total fee to 200 francs . While no figures exist , it is thought that many small investors in Belgium store securities privately , in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes . The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks , who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors .
share.n | 2 | `` We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives , '' the trust spokeswoman said . `` We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries . '' The trust , created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases , owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares , which are each convertible into 10 Manville common %% shares %% . The trust also owns half of Manville 's 48 million common shares outstanding . Based on Manville 's closing price yesterday of $ 9.25 a share , Manville 's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares , or about 75 % of the trust 's preferred stock holding .
share.n | 2 | A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes . But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement . Manville said the %% shares %% issued to the trust were intended to be sold , as needed , and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares .
share.n | 2 | They do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically . Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy %% shares %% from sellers when no one else will . In such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses . But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale .
share.n | 2 | Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1\/2 , also up 1\/4 , on volume of 700,000 . Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1\/8 to 49 1\/2 . The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a %% share %% , down from $ 1.26 a year earlier . The company estimated that losses from Hurricane Hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter .

share.n | 2 | Remarketers make modifications to IBM 's computer hardware and resell the products . Omni Capital Group surged 1 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 . The company said net rose to 38 cents a %% share %% in its fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30 , from 35 cents a shares a year ago .
share.n | 2 | The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 . The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2 % decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3 % rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period . Generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed %% shares %% that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold . Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks . Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues , short interest rose to 196.8 million shares , from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September .
share.n | 2 | First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line . Short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market . Shorted %% shares %% must eventually be replaced through buying . In addition , changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage . For example , an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other .
share.n | 2 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 %% shares %% existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 ( see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 ) .
share.n | 2 | Procter & Gamble Co. , helped by a gain from a lawsuit settlement and continued growth overseas , posted a 38 % rise in fiscal first-quarter net income . Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 climbed to $ 551 million , or $ 1.66 a share , from $ 400 million , or $ 1.18 a %% share %% , a year earlier . Per-share figures have been adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 20 . Sales increased 6 % to $ 5.58 billion from $ 5.27 billion .
share.n | 2 | Last year 's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases , boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils , analysts said . For fiscal 1990 , analysts expect P&G 's sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % . Lynne Hyman , vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp. , expects P&G to post net of about $ 4.20 a %% share %% , on a post-split basis . `` But I 'm recognizing there 's a good chance they 'll do a bit better than that , '' she says . In fiscal 1989 , P&G earned $ 3.56 a share , adjusted for the stock split .
share.n | 2 | Brush Wellman Inc. said its board increased the number of shares of common stock to be purchased under a previously authorized program to 3.9 million from 2.9 million . The maker of engineered materials has acquired more than 2.7 million %% shares %% under the program .
share.n | 2 | Wall Street securities giant Salomon Inc. posted a big , unexpected earnings gain in the third quarter , buoyed by its securities trading and investment banking activities . Salomon said net income soared to $ 177 million , or $ 1.28 a share , from $ 65 million , or 38 cents a %% share %% , a year earlier . Revenue more than doubled to $ 2.62 billion from $ 1.29 billion . A Salomon spokesman said its stock , bond and foreign exchange trading , as well as its investment banking operations , were mostly responsible for the earnings jump .
share.n | 2 | Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares , which would have a current value of more than $ 1.7 billion . The buy-back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares , would reduce %% shares %% outstanding by more than 26 % . The Norfolk , Va. , company has 172.2 million shares outstanding . In a statement , Arnold B. McKinnon , chairman and chief executive officer , noted that the new repurchase program `` should serve to enhance shareholder value . ''
share.n | 2 | The buy-back `` is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a { price } floor , '' he said . `` At a certain price , if the management thinks { the stock } is cheap , they can go in and buy it . '' Under the program , Norfolk plans to acquire %% shares %% in the open market . Under the earlier plan , Norfolk was authorized in 1987 to buy up to 20 million shares . It has purchased about 19 million of them .
share.n | 2 | Quarter net for the business-machines and financial-services company rose to $ 155 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 146 million , or $ 1.37 a share , in the year-earlier period . Revenue rose to $ 4.45 billion from $ 4.15 billion . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Xerox closed at $ 62.75 a %% share %% , up $ 1 . Sales growth and profit in business products and systems -- Xerox 's main business -- were `` disappointing , '' said B. Alex Henderson , who follows the company for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . Sales of Xerox copiers and other office products grew 1.6 % ; `` we expected growth of 6 % to 7 % , '' Mr. Henderson said .
share.n | 2 | CHICAGO - Sears , Roebuck & Co. is struggling as it enters the critical Christmas season . Yesterday , the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16 % drop in third-quarter earnings to $ 257.5 million , or 75 cents a share , from a restated $ 305 million , or 80 cents a %% share %% , a year earlier . But the news was even worse for Sears 's core U.S. retailing operation , the largest in the nation . Sears said its U.S. stores had a loss of $ 6.9 million , their first deficit for the period in more than five years .
share.n | 2 | Apogee Enterprises Inc. said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $ 1.9 million related to a project that was guaranteed by the company . A year ago , the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $ 4 million , or 30 cents a %% share %% , on revenue of $ 114 million . Apogee said the charge stems from a building supply contract in which the company guaranteed a contractor 's performance . Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own , making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project .
share.n | 2 | That 's a big number . Warner also had a gain of more than 13 % from records and music publishing , even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer . '' In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a %% share %% . Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion . On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier .
share.n | 2 | Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business . Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a %% share %% , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago . Sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion the previous year . Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
share.n | 2 | That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business . Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits . For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a %% share %% , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago . Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
share.n | 2 | Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said . But some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues . Yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million %% shares %% was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million . For October so far , daily volume is averaging 150.3 million , putting it on track to be the year 's busiest month . Apple Computer , which reported lackluster earnings Friday , lost 1 1\/4 to 46 3\/4 on 1.1 million shares .
share.n | 2 | Stratus Computer , which reported earnings late Friday that were in line with a disappointing forecast , eased 3\/4 to 24 on 816,000 shares . Investors apparently did n't like the news from Rainbow Technologies either . It said net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter , compared with 16 cents a %% share %% a year earlier . Rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 1\/4 . Other technology stocks that were weaker included Intel , which fell 1 1\/4 to 33 1\/2 on 1.9 million shares , Mentor Graphics , down 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 on 1.6 million shares , Sun Microsystems , which slipped 3\/8 to 18 1\/4 , and MCI Communications , down 1 to 42 3\/4 .
share.n | 2 | Conner Peripherals was unchanged at 15 . Among takeover stocks , Jefferson Smurfit jumped 1 1\/4 to 42 1\/2 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to Jefferson Smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share . The increase of $ 1.25 a %% share %% is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to SIBV-MS 's tender offer . SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership . The Jefferson Smurfit affiliate , Smurfit International B.V. , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding .
share.n | 2 | The Jefferson Smurfit affiliate , Smurfit International B.V. , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding . These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares . Another takeover target , LIN Broadcasting , eased 1\/2 to 110 1\/8 on 313,800 %% shares %% . LIN 's suitor , McCaw Cellular Communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares . Some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments .
share.n | 2 | He puts the OTC market 's Nellcor , Office Club and BizMart on the list . Nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up 3\/4 to 16 7\/8 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 3\/4 on 65,200 shares . BizMart , another retailing stock , was off 3\/8 to 8 1\/4 on nearly 80,000 %% shares %% . Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session . Payco American , a credit collection concern , jumped 1 3\/8 to 20 5\/8 on volume of 93,000 , and Mail Boxes Etc. , a private postal services company , advanced 1\/2 to 23 1\/2 on volume of 64,000 .
share.n | 2 | The Arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state . Higher earnings helped some issues . Amgen rose 2 1\/4 to 54 3\/4 on almost 800,000 %% shares %% , and CVB Financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares .
share.n | 2 | Sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million . The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co . Mr. Sheridan , who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ 1.25 a %% share %% , says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10 . Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report . He said Eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated .
share.n | 2 | Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million . The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market . For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a %% share %% , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago . Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier . Nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier .

Nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a %% share %% , down $ 2.50 .
share.n | 2 | McDonald 's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement . The world 's largest fast-food chain said net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a %% share %% , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago . In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level . Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.46 billion .
share.n | 2 | Reflecting better growth prospects abroad , McDonald 's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion . At the end of the third quarter McDonald 's had 10,873 units operating world-wide . In the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a %% share %% , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier . Revenue rose 11 % to $ 4.56 billion from $ 4.12 billion .
share.n | 2 | Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. 's net income rose 29 % on a modest 9 % increase in revenue in the third quarter , mainly on strong advertising demand at its ABC television network operation . Demand for ads also rose at the eight TV stations Capital Cities owns and at its 80%-owned ESPN sports cable channel . The broadcast and publishing company reported net climbed to $ 80.8 million , or $ 4.56 a %% share %% , from $ 62.6 million , or $ 3.55 a share , in the year-earlier period . Revenue reached $ 1.1 billion from $ 1.01 billion . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Capital Cities closed at $ 558.50 , down $ 5 .
share.n | 2 | Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he said the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market . In major market activity : Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 135.9 million %% shares %% . Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers , 1,012 to 501 . Bond prices rallied .
share.n | 2 | One major advantage of the revised plan is that Aztar will have far less debt than under the old terms . `` They 'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies , '' said Daniel Lee , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . Mr. Lee values the package at between $ 15 and $ 20 a %% share %% , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks . The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in October 1988 , must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in Nevada and New Jersey . Financing plans include raising $ 170 million in debt secured by the company 's holdings in New Jersey .
share.n | 2 | The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares . The airline 's share price already is far below the 210 pence ( $ 3.33 ) level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late September . In late trading on London 's Stock Exchange yesterday , the %% shares %% were off three pence at 194 pence . And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions .
share.n | 2 | The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission : American Exploration Co. , offering of five million common shares , via Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .

share.n | 2 | Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per %% share %% . Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
share.n | 2 | Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $ 305 million from $ 274 million last year . Revenue declined 3.4 % , to $ 8.4 billion from $ 8.7 billion . Per-share earnings declined to $ 1.10 a share from $ 1.12 a %% share %% , largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $ 1 billion of debt . Per-share earnings also shrank because of dividends on a new series of preferred stock . Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
share.n | 2 | Shell 's chemical earnings fell by $ 67 million , to $ 137 million , reflecting lower margins and less demand for commodity chemicals . Mobil Net income at Mobil Corp. slipped 4.5 % to $ 532 million , or $ 1.30 a %% share %% , from $ 557 million , or $ 1.36 a share . Revenue declined $ 518 million , to $ 13.63 billion . Earnings included a one-time gain of $ 192 million on a property transaction in Hong Kong .
share.n | 2 | The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when . The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company 's %% shares %% without permission until Dec. 31 , But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner . A successful vote would put pressure on the British government to lift the restriction .
share.n | 2 | The prospect of such a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks . U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares . In a declining London stock market yesterday , Jaguar %% shares %% were down four pence from Monday in late trading , at 694 pence ( $ 11.11 ) a share . In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 . Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets .
share.n | 2 | The overall London market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating . The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index plummeted 40.4 points to close at 2149.3 . Traders credited Euro Disney 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the %% shares %% are destined to help finance : Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris .

share.n | 2 | U.S. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from EC investors 90 days later . Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market . A volatile , unofficial `` gray '' market in the %% shares %% has been operating in Paris for about two weeks . In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 1\/2 francs ( $ 12.66 ) bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price . `` A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing , '' cautioned Alistair Cuddeford , a London-based Salomon Brothers International Ltd. trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares .

But traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken .
share.n | 2 | Other airline stocks fell in response to the UAL board 's decision to remain independent for now , including USAir Group , which separately reported a third-quarter loss of $ 1.86 a share compared with a year-ago profit .

share.n | 2 | HomeFed plunged 3 5\/8 to 38 1\/2 ; its third-quarter earnings were down from a year ago . Golden Valley Microwave Foods skidded 3 5\/8 to 31 3\/4 after warning that its fourth-quarter results could be hurt by `` some fairly large international marketing expenses .

share.n | 2 | Rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company , but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened . `` The board has stated repeatedly that Rubbermaid should be independent , '' said Walter W. Williams , Rubbermaid president . Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments , but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25 % or more of Rubbermaid 's voting securities , each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid %% shares %% with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price . Mr. Williams said the exercise price is $ 125 , meaning holders would have the right to buy $ 250 of Rubbermaid stock for half price , diluting the investor 's 25 % stake . For the third quarter , Rubbermaid earned $ 32.6 million , or 44 cents a share , up 16 % from $ 28.1 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
share.n | 2 | In this second LBO , KKR with one hand took more than $ 1 billion of cash out of the TV company 's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations , making them more valuable in a 1988 sale . ( Storer also took $ 125 million of junior SCI TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets . ) With the other hand , KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10 % of the cash it had taken out , buying SCI TV common and preferred %% shares %% . So , while KKR today has an estimated $ 250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV , including equity and debt , the LBO firm still is $ 1 billion ahead on the SCI TV buy-out after taking cash up front . On Storer as a whole , KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60 % in the three years it owned Storer .
share.n | 2 | Times Mirror Co. said third-quarter net income fell 13 % to $ 70.1 million , or 54 cents a %% share %% , compared with net income of $ 81 million , or 62 cents a share , a year earlier .

Revenue was $ 873.9 million , up 7.3 % from $ 814.8 million .
share.n | 2 | Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction . The board 's decision , announced after the market closed Monday , initially prompted a severe sell-off in UAL shares , which at midday traded as low as $ 145 a share , down $ 33 a %% share %% , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock traders , who by then had seen UAL stock tumble 49 % since Oct. 12 , also triggered a marketwide sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 80 points at 10:40 a.m . But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market .
share.n | 2 | Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150 a share , triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 points in the final hour of trading . UAL stock closed at $ 170 a share , down $ 8.375 . Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million %% shares %% , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding . Traders estimated that Bear , Stearns bought more than 1 million shares . The two most frequently rumored buyers , neither of whom would comment , were Coniston Partners , which battled the UAL board in 1987 , and New York real estate developer Donald Trump , who recently made and withdrew an offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp .
share.n | 2 | That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose . However , a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday . The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240 a %% share %% , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . One person familiar with UAL said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month . Even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't quarrel with the board 's logic .
share.n | 2 | In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says . Federal 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks , analysts say . Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's %% shares %% have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . They closed Friday at $ 53.25 , down 50 cents on the day . There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase .
share.n | 2 | Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per %% share %% . Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .

share.n | 2 | A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever . The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies . Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million %% shares %% was considerably higher than in September . Program trading amounted to 12.3 % of average daily volume in June . The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
share.n | 2 | The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders . Tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375 a share to close at $ 44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a %% share %% , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier . The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income . Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier .
share.n | 2 | Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said . As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 . Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a %% share %% , in the year ended June 30 . Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market . Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines .
share.n | 2 | In March , Qintex sold 49 % of the three Mirage resorts to Japan 's Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui & Co. for A$ 433 million . Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire Qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts . Before its shares were suspended from trading , Qintex Australia plunged to 16 Australian cents ( 12 U.S. cents ) a %% share %% yesterday from 33 Australian cents Friday . The shares traded at about A$ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire MGM\/UA was announced . Qintex Ltd. shares sank to A$ 1.50 yesterday from A$ 3.05 Friday .
share.n | 2 | It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern . Nuovo Banco will become Italy 's biggest private-sector bank when it completes its scheduled merger with Banca Cattolica del Venetoen by year end . Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco %% shares %% , the Italian news agency ANSA reported . The tribunal is scheduled to rule on the request Friday . No reason for the request was given .
share.n | 2 | First Executive Corp. said about 96 % of the rights to purchase its depositary %% shares %% and warrants have been exercised . Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said . Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units .
share.n | 2 | Archive Corp. said it expects to report net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 29 of a record $ 15 million , or $ 1.15 a %% share %% , up 43 % from $ 10.5 million , or 80 cents a share , for the prior year . The Costa Mesa , Calif. , maker of computer tape drives also projected record revenue for the year of $ 181 million , up from $ 122.7 million for the previous year . Archive attributed the gains to strong demand for its products , continued growth of the reseller market and the acquisition of Maynard Electronics in February , which accounted for about 14 % of the company 's revenue .
share.n | 2 | In the year-ago quarter , the software developer reported pro forma earnings of $ 4.8 million , or 24 cents a share . Vienna , Va.-based Legent said it expects to post revenue for the quarter of more than $ 31 million , compared with pro forma revenue of $ 25.2 million in 1988 . For the fiscal year , the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $ 23 million , or about $ 1.15 a %% share %% , including a charge of about $ 5.9 million , or 22 cents a share , related to the merger that created Legent out of Duquesne Systems Inc. and Morino Inc. in March 1989 . Revenue for fiscal 1989 is expected to exceed $ 124 million . Pro forma earnings for fiscal 1988 were $ 19.6 million , or 99 cents a share , on revenue of $ 97.2 million .
share.n | 2 | A decline in Allied-Signal Inc. 's automotive business contributed to flat sales and only slightly higher earnings in the third quarter . Allied-Signal reported that net rose 1.7 % to $ 121 million , or 81 cents a share , from $ 119 million , or 80 cents a %% share %% , the year earlier .

share.n | 2 | A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a %% share %% , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year . Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . Belo said it increased its effective tax rate to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 .
share.n | 2 | The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year . For the nine months , the company had net income of $ 15.1 million , or 74 cents a %% share %% , up 98 % from $ 7.6 million , or 38 cents a share last year .

Jim Farooquee , chief executive officer of the Tustin , Calif. , computer accessories supplier , said he was `` comfortable '' with analysts ' expectations that CMS would earn between six cents and eight cents a %% share %% on revenue of about $ 42 million . A year earlier , CMS posted profit of $ 1.1 million , or 13 cents a share , on sales of $ 48 million . This time , there are 30 % more shares outstanding .

In the year-earlier period , the maker of diesel engines and parts had a narrower deficit of $ 17.6 million , or $ 1.84 a %% share %% , with sales of $ 808.3 million . A spokeswoman said shipments of truck engines , which provide a higher margin than most of the company 's other products , declined 16 % from a year earlier .

The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 7.81 at 2687.53 . Relatively stable foreign currency dealings Monday were viewed favorably by market players , traders said .
share.n | 2 | The Financial Times 100-share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7 . The 30-share index closed 11.6 points higher at 1772.6 . Volume was 276.8 million %% shares %% , beneath the year 's previous low of 280.5 million shares Sept. 25 , the session before the August trade figures were released .

share.n | 2 | Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock %% shares %% compounded the view , they say . `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer . `` If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown .

share.n | 2 | When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary ... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . '' Though the bank is n't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative California market , its condition has improved since Mr. Decker took over . For the six months ended June 30 , it earned $ 3.1 million , or 61 cents a %% share %% , compared with net income of $ 2.4 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier . Its stock also has risen lately , at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate . Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991 , and larger California banks , such as Wells Fargo & Co. , have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray .
share.n | 2 | Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. said the Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from the two companies about their announced intention to acquire Vermont American Corp. for $ 40 a %% share %% , or about $ 440 million .

The FTC 's request was `` not unusual '' and Emerson will make a `` full and prompt '' response , according to a spokesman .
share.n | 2 | But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market . `` Their principal asset is Manville common stock , '' says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville %% shares %% . `` If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail . What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . ''
share.n | 2 | We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its %% shares %% before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name . Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders .
share.n | 2 | Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a %% share %% , a year earlier .

share.n | 2 | Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs . Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends . Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte %% share %% . Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid . Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it .
share.n | 2 | Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced advancers , 1,012 to 501 . Recession fears are springing up again among investors . Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in %% shares %% of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets . In an economic slowdown , heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments . On the other hand , investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records .
share.n | 2 | Union Carbide , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined 1\/2 to 24 1\/2 . Also , Exxon went down 3\/8 to 45 3\/4 and Allied-Signal lost 7\/8 to 35 1\/8 even though the companies ' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts . Other weak blue-chip issues included Chevron , which went down 2 to 64 7\/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.3 million %% shares %% ; Goodyear Tire & Rubber , off 1 1\/2 to 46 3\/4 , and American Express , down 3\/4 to 37 1\/4 . Texas Instruments , which had reported Friday that third-quarter earnings fell more than 30 % from the year-ago level , went down 2 1\/8 to 33 on 1.1 million shares . Motorola , another major semiconductor producer , dropped 1 1\/8 to 57 1\/2 .
share.n | 2 | Other stocks hurt by earnings-related selling included Tandy , which dropped 1 3\/8 to 44 , and Eaton , which retreated 2 1\/2 to 57 1\/2 . Third-quarter earnings at both companies were below analysts ' forecasts . After declining about 41 % last week , UAL advanced 9 7\/8 to 178 3\/8 on 1.1 million %% shares %% on anticipation of a revised takeover offer from a labor-management group for the parent company of United Airlines . However , Delta Air Lines fell 1 1\/2 to 67 1\/2 and USAir Group dropped 3\/4 to 42 1\/2 . Ramada gained 7\/8 to 11 1\/4 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan , which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $ 540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders .

share.n | 2 | Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news . UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 %% shares %% at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid .
share.n | 2 | Inco Ltd. posted a 35 % decline in third-quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations . The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding . Inco %% shares %% fell after the announcements . Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend . Inco closed at $ 31.125 a share , down 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
share.n | 2 | Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year . The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3 . Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a %% share %% , a year earlier . Sales rose 8.2 % to $ 848.7 million from $ 784.5 million . Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
share.n | 2 | Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore . Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable . Under a previous buyback program , Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its %% shares %% since April .
share.n | 2 | Texaco Inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million , its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with Pennzoil Co. began more than four years ago . The White Plains , N.Y. , oil company said Friday that it had acquired Tana Production Corp. , a subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc. , for $ 95.1 million in cash , with the rest to be paid in %% shares %% of a new , non-voting issue of preferred stock .

share.n | 2 | Convex Computer Corp. , continuing its rapid growth while other computer companies falter , reported an 87 % increase in third-quarter net income from a year earlier and a 50 % increase in revenue .

share.n | 2 | The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service . In the meantime , the question faced by investors is : What is UAL stock worth ? The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a %% share %% . That 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year . Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings .
share.n | 2 | The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a %% share %% based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection . Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike .
share.n | 2 | In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding . Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding . Frank Gallagher , an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a %% share %% for their UAL positions . That would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on UAL alone totalling $ 725 million . UAL Corp . ( NYSE ; Symbol : UAL )

James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate %% share %% of high earnings stocks .

The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 32.71 to 1230.80 amid renewed weakness in the airline sector . UAL skidded 21 5\/8 to 168 1\/2 on 2.2 million %% shares %% . On the week , UAL was down nearly 40 % . The latest drop followed a decision by British Airways , which had supported the $ 300-a-share buy-out offer for UAL from a labor-management group , not to participate in any revised bid .
share.n | 2 | Winnebago Industries slid 5\/8 to 5 1\/4 . The company , which reported that its loss for the fiscal quarter ended Aug. 26 widened from a year earlier , cut its semiannual dividend in half in response to the earnings weakness .

A year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199,203 or nine cents a %% share %% , on revenue of $ 7.6 million .
share.n | 2 | Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility . Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview . But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a %% share %% , in 1988 . That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate . In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .

Only a year ago , the chairman of Bond Corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies .
share.n | 2 | Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago . Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent .

share.n | 2 | Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now . Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't . In recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his %% shares %% . Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ? The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .

A couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group . MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along with a letter saying that was the charity 's `` %% share %% .

The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector . However , the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter .
share.n | 2 | Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers . Arthur Fleischer Jr. , a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds . One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a %% share %% . A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk bonds . But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time .
share.n | 2 | Net was aided by a lower income tax rate . Profit before taxes fell 17 % to $ 84.4 million from $ 101.4 million . For the nine months , Textron reported net of $ 182.1 million , or $ 2.06 a %% share %% , on revenue of $ 5.41 billion .

Short interest is the number of %% shares %% that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders . Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back . Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
share.n | 2 | Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp. , consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp. , for $ 577.3 million of cash and securities .

share.n | 2 | They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single %% share %% of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . `` There is n't a boatload { of big investors } out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services .
share.n | 2 | Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .

Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % .
share.n | 2 | The company said the decline was attributable to a 79 % reduction in net gains on loan sales this year .

share.n | 2 | But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth , Mr. Sit says . He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate ( down from about 14 % the past five years ) and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block %% shares %% being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , H&R Block does n't even come close . Two other money managers , in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year , spoke on the condition they not be named .

Dealers said the market was underpinned by a squeeze in FT-SE 100 stocks , particularly among market-makers seeking shares that had been hit hard in recent weeks , such as retailers and building-related concerns . But despite the flurry of interest in those %% shares %% , dealers said , the market remains nervous about Wall Street 's volatility and high U.K. interest rates . U.K. money supply figures for September , released yesterday , showed continued growth in corporate and personal lending , which will keep pressure on the government to maintain tight credit . Among the stocks featured in the market-makers ' squeeze was Sears , which closed at 107 pence ( $ 1.70 ) a share , up 3 .

share.n | 2 | Schlumberger Ltd. , New York , reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income . The lower interest income occurred because Schlumberger spent $ 1.2 billion buying back its stock last year .

share.n | 2 | Dell Computer Corp. , squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line , said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts . Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ 385 million for the year ending Jan. 28 , 1990 , earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a %% share %% , down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents .

Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 , are expected to be released the third week of November , according to Michael Dell , chairman and chief executive officer .
share.n | 2 | Analyst James Weil of the Soundview Financial Group believes Dell 's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality , `` in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure . '' But that has been the key to Compaq 's success , he adds , whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy . In national over-the-counter trading , Dell closed yesterday at $ 6 a %% share %% , down 87.5 cents .
share.n | 1 | Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army , the State Department is talking again about accepting an `` interim '' coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh . The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk , and the Khmer Rouge . The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small %% share %% of power . The State Department says that any Khmer Rouge participation would have to be `` minimal . '' The usual problem with including communists in `` interim '' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else .

Kuse , the company 's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement .

share.n | 2 | Continental Bank Corp. 's third-quarter net income slipped 11 % despite a big gain from the sale of the company 's London headquarters building . The $ 55 million gain on the sale was offset by lower interest income , poorer results from foreign-exchange trading and a $ 9 million loss on the sale of a unit , Securities Settlement Corp . Chicago-based Continental earned $ 65.2 million , or $ 1.04 a share , compared with $ 73.6 million , or $ 1.19 a %% share %% , a year earlier . The 1988 quarter also included one-time gains totaling about $ 35 million .

UAL , the parent company of United Airlines , swung within a 14-point range during the course of the session before closing at 191 3\/4 , down 6 1\/4 , on 2.3 million shares .

Separately , investor Marvin Davis withdrew his backup $ 300-a-share takeover offer . While UAL faltered , AMR , the parent of American Airlines , pulled out of its recent nosedive by rising 3\/4 to 74 .

share.n | 2 | Mr. Buffett 's firm , Berkshire Hathaway , holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt 's firm , Steinhardt Partners . Now , in the wake of UAL 's troubles in financing its buy-out , the airline raiding game has been grounded . Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ 80 a %% share %% , Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $ 45 , on average , but yesterday closed at 40 1\/2 , up 1\/4 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . `` It does n't make sense to parachute out at this price , '' Mr. Steinhardt says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends USAir managers ' `` operating skills . '' At the current price , the USAir holding represents 9 % of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages .
share.n | 2 | `` Long-term investing -- that 's not Steinhardt 's style , '' chuckles an investor who once worked at Steinhardt Partners . `` He does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole , '' adds another Steinhardt Partners alumnus . In recent days , traders say USAir has been buying its own shares , as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir %% shares %% , though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program . If USAir stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out , says Timothy Pettee , a Merrill Lynch analyst . But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt , he adds .

share.n | 2 | Analysts have estimated that Pinnacle West may have to inject between $ 300 million and $ 400 million into the MeraBank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators . The latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company , based in Phoenix , Ariz. , reflect continuing problems at MeraBank and losses in real-estate , venture-capital and uranium-mining operations . Third-quarter net income slid to $ 5.1 million , or six cents a %% share %% , from $ 56 million , or 65 cents , a year earlier . Utility operations , the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period , had a 26 % drop in profit , to $ 86.3 million , largely as a result of outages at the company 's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power . In other operations , losses at MeraBank totaled $ 85.7 million in the latest quarter , compared with a $ 2.5 million profit a year earlier .

The Queks control the Hong Leong Group , which has widespread interests in manufacturing , property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore . News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday , but brokers said that the market and CDL %% shares %% recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally .

It had profit of $ 48.6 million , or $ 2.46 a share , in the 1988 period .

share.n | 2 | '' Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew . Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire . The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar %% shares %% without permission until Dec. 31 , 1990 . But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely . `` It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar , observed Mr. Barber of James Capel .
share.n | 2 | The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase . Revenue rose 95 % to $ 86.4 million from $ 44.3 million the year earlier . In national over-the-counter trading , the company closed yesterday at $ 23.25 a %% share %% , down 25 cents .

Ahmanson & Co. , which reported lower earnings yesterday .
share.n | 2 | `` We view it as a good long-term investment , '' the spokesman said . In the short term , the move is likely to have little effect . At yesterday 's closing price , $ 1 billion would buy back about 10 million %% shares %% , or less than 2 % of the roughly 580 million outstanding . In addition , as of Sept. 30 , the company still had authorization to buy $ 368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program . Over the long term , however , IBM 's stock repurchases -- along with its hefty , $ 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors -- are providing a floor for the stock price .

share.n | 2 | Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51 % increase in third-quarter net income on a 32 % sales gain , buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet . The results topped analysts ' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors , prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years . Yesterday , in heavy , national over-the-counter trading , Lotus %% shares %% rose to $ 32.50 , up $ 1.25 apiece , capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40 % .

The aerospace concern earned $ 28.8 million , or 61 cents a share , a year earlier .
share.n | 2 | General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales . Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Northrop %% shares %% closed at $ 21.125 , off 25 cents . General Dynamics closed at $ 54.875 , up 50 cents . Northrop , which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development , said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago .

share.n | 2 | The Fort Worth , Texas , company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business , and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days . Meanwhile , the company 's board , which had said nothing publicly about investor Donald Trump 's recently withdrawn $ 7.5 billion offer for AMR , issued a statement condemning `` ill-conceived and reckless '' bids and saying it was `` pleased '' that Mr. Trump had backed out . In the third quarter , AMR said , net fell to $ 137 million , or $ 2.16 a %% share %% , from $ 150.3 million , or $ 2.50 a share . Revenue rose 17 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.33 billion a year earlier . AMR 's chairman , Robert L. Crandall , said the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield , an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold .
share.n | 2 | Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day , finishing little changed despite the dollar 's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon . Helped by futures-related program buying , the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.92 points to close at 2643.65 . But the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell for the seventh-consecutive session as more investors dumped UAL %% shares %% . Bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy Treasury issues on fears that the Northern California earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle . But when stocks held steady , Treasury bonds later retreated .

share.n | 2 | Confusion about the two banks ' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the UAL board has n't even seen yet helped send UAL stock spiraling downward . And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday . Yesterday 's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks , which balked at the first bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around $ 250 a %% share %% , or $ 5.65 billion . Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up .

UAL tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million %% shares %% , and AMR declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands . Together , the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders , and caused a 7.3 % drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19 , 1987 . Some said Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal .
share.n | 2 | In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares . AMR was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 . Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a %% share %% , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 . Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees . However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .

start.v | 3 | Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95 % of the market share . Nestle currently has only about a 2 % share with its Taster 's Choice coffee . Poland plans to %% start %% negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from Iran , the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported . The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland 's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi 's current visit to Warsaw . The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered .
start.v | 2 | A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey . New trade accords were signed . It all %% started %% with geography . When it opened in 1939 , Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America . Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets , but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop .
start.v | 3 | The first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the Old Testament . A storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames . Later accounts blamed defective wiring for %% starting %% the fire ; ; at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the K'ang-si pottery to cinders . Wright set his loss at $ 200,000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed . In spite of the disaster , Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .
start.v | 2 | In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet . She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values . When he %% started %% school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale . Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies . When he was eight he began violin lessons .
start.v | 2 | Will the danger increase or decrease ? ? I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could %% start %% a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched . There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .
start.v | 2 | The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion . On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire . At the slope 's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children 's hoops , stopped simultaneously , weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child 's touch to %% start %% them all rolling again . Closer still , regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports . Was it all vain labor ? ?
start.v | 2 | Finding the key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator '' . He saw the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen . He kept on laughing until she %% started %% laughing with him . He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it . He would settle himself into his seat to laugh .
start.v | 2 | Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan . A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port . When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had %% started %% to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled . As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers . `` Sex is overpriced '' , he said .
start.v | 2 | His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child . There was only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept . He %% started %% by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper . Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself . At the same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved .
start.v | 5 | `` Let him be now '' ! ! Pierre Ameaux , the gaming-card manufacturer said , his little pig eyes glaring . `` We have taught him a lesson '' . The crowd moved back and John %% started %% dizzily down the hill . Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward . Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow .
start.v | 2 | C'mon -- 'mon ! ! '' I 'm no hero . Did I %% start %% the damn war ? ? Automatically , Finnegan started going over today 's lesson . Capitalism rots from the core .
start.v | 1 | Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh . `` Okay , I 'm Happy . Where do I %% start %% '' ? ? Jubal did not hear of Digby 's disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion , he dismissed it ; ; if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered . His household had gone through an upset .
start.v | 1 | A man could make a mark there . Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one 's ever been . %% Start %% out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' . `` Yes , like a father and son '' . `` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .
start.v | 5 | Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him . He said : `` If it 's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I 'll sleep out here on the couch . We have n't slept together since we %% started %% . I just can n't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I do n't savvy why you 'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' .
start.v | 2 | His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling . Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar . A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman 's stomach as Blue Throat 's henchmen %% started %% shooting . Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun . The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .
start.v | 5 | `` Well , damn '' , Waddell said . There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline . He %% started %% out the door . `` One moment '' ! ! Herr Schaffner said . `` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?
start.v | 2 | But he read on . In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , %% Start %% wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' . Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words . `` Oh , it 's that myth , about Orpheus and What is her name ? ?
start.v | 2 | `` I 'll pick murder . Anything else '' ? ? `` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and %% started %% hauling him out .
start.v | 2 | The Indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson 's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian 's lips . Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . I %% started %% looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle . We were slowing . In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming .
start.v | 2 | But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled . Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan . He %% started %% to struggle up , heaving desperately . Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach . Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned .
start.v | 5 | I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari . Tell her to come here to the hotel '' . Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and %% started %% toward the door . `` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said . `` You 're not to mention my name .
start.v | 1 | Jess did n't seem too sure himself . He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall . Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which %% started %% at the floor . Jess had had enough . Blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt 's fists .
start.v | 2 | They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun . `` Just come along '' , Brannon told him . `` Do n't %% start %% anything you ca n't finish '' . `` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began . `` We 'll talk over at your office '' .
start.v | 2 | She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . `` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . He saw her hand %% start %% to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . `` I 've had enough of that .
start.v | 2 | At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony . I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball . He %% started %% to run but Oso 's shot caught him on the wing . He jerked once in the grass and lay still . `` If you 're goin ' to kill 'em -- ! ! Kill 'em '' ! ! Oso growled .
start.v | 2 | `` Well , let 's see . Let 's make a list of your assets '' . Maggie %% started %% laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining . When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures . `` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said .
start.v | 2 | But then , he had n't studied very hard . Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking . He put down his pipe and %% started %% to type . `` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' . He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College .
start.v | 2 | I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine 's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door . Her face was flushed from sleep . `` It 's all right '' , I said , as she %% started %% to look scared . `` Mrs. Roberts had called , and could n't wake you . I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
start.v | 2 | He had to go into the water . He 'd tell Sabella about the nightmare . It had %% started %% two years ago when he was in an iron lung . What caused it , he did n't know . The metal collar gagging his neck ? ?
start.v | 2 | Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water . Doc Doolittle 's scheduled appearance at captain 's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report . But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual , too , and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had %% started %% it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing . Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer did n't know . In his opinion , Doc had not grown up .
start.v | 2 | No . I 'm not saying it right . What I meant to say was that I started to %% start %% in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband . How about them , I thought .
start.v | 2 | The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach . Furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot . The cycle of disaster %% starts %% the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . Sort of remorseless , is n't it ? ? Still , there it is .
start.v | 2 | `` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? ? Forty years ago an English writer , W.L. George , dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for Merry England ' would not %% start %% a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead ' '' ! ! `` There was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage . It is n't what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy .
start.v | 3 | And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` %% starting %% a family '' . Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around .
state.n | 2 | States are following suit . California enacted a rights law in 1988 . In 1989 , Illinois , Kansas , Ohio , Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws , the Federation of Tax Administrators , a %% state %% officials ' group , reports ; the features vary . And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states . One group is the Committee on State Taxation , which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce .
state.n | 2 | Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $ 800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake . The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the %% state %% legislature that begins tomorrow , would cover only part of the estimated $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake . Aside from as much as $ 3.45 billion in recently approved federal aid , the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $ 700 million . `` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline '' of the revenue-raising plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question .
state.n | 2 | Ashurst is new to the Far East . Sidley will maintain its association with the Hashidate Law Office in Tokyo . THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union 's claim that the %% state %% of Michigan engages in wage-discrimination against female employees . A three-judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday . The UAW is seeking a hearing by the full 14-judge panel .
state.n | 1 | Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers . The Venezuelan central bank set a 30 % floor on the bidding . A song by American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela was banned from South African %% state %% radio and television . The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the song `` Freedom Now '' was `` undesirable for broadcasting . '' ... Britain 's House of Commons passed a law that will force English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums .
state.n | 2 | One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all . The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . '' He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by %% state %% investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them . `` I do n't know whose toes I 've stepped on , '' says the judge . `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . ''
state.n | 2 | `` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat , a newspaper in nearby Johnstown , shortly after the scandal became public . `` If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago , the judicial process would n't be under the taint it is today . '' Officials with the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board , the arm of the %% state %% that investigates judicial misconduct , counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in Ebensburg . `` Nobody told us ; nobody called us , '' says an official close to the case who asked not to be named . `` Nobody had the guts to complain . ''
state.n | 2 | `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County . The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987 , after the %% state %% attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County . The inquiry soon focused on the judge . Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
state.n | 1 | Norway 's unemployment rate for October was 3.6 % , unchanged from September but up from 2.6 % in the same month last year . The figure excludes a record number employed by extraordinary government work programs , the Labor Directorate announced Tuesday . Including those in the %% state %% programs , there were 143,800 Norwegians , or about 6.5 % of the work force , without permanent employment in October , up from September 's 136,800 . The number of people registered as jobless at the end of October declined by 900 from September to 78,600 . Those employed in state-funded special programs increased by 7,400 to 65,200 in the same period , the Directorate said .
state.n | 1 | Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research . The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed . John Bolton , the assistant secretary of %% state %% for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` statist , restrictive , nondemocratic '' programs make rejoining any time soon `` extremely unlikely . '' This has n't much bothered the UNESCO delegates , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns . Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership .
state.n | 2 | `` It sure smells like it , '' he said . He said 30 % of the loans he sampled were `` dead meat on the day they were made . '' The %% state %% examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of Lincoln 's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious . `` Later on , my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious , '' he said . He called the sour loans `` appalling '' and added , `` You opened the file up and it just jumped at you . ''
state.n | 2 | Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a %% state %% imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years . So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait .
state.n | 2 | This involves trade-offs and { it } cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary . ' '' The AFL-CIO also embraces treatment guidelines . In addition , it 's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual %% states %% as a way to slow health-care spending . At a meeting here on Nov. 15 , the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul .
state.n | 2 | The current dispute involves allegations that Charlotte , N.C.-based First Union has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act . During the summer , Legal Services Corp. , a Florida legal aid group , filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties . The petition challenged First Union 's lending record in the %% state %% , saying that the bank-holding company had `` shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state . '' In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow { it } to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . '' The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks .
state.n | 2 | The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York %% state %% for age discrimination against appointed state judges . The suit , filed in federal court in Manhattan , charges that New York 's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law . Separately , the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge 's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven .
state.n | 2 | The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination . The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of ( New York 's ) unlawful employment practices . '' Justice Rubin , a %% state %% judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number . The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
state.n | 2 | A spokeswoman for the state 's Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit . But she said the state currently has 35 appointed judges who are over 70 . In Connecticut , however , most %% state %% judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature . The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont . In the Vermont case , a federal judge ruled that the state 's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal ; Vermont 's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan .
state.n | 3 | `` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says Bert Vogelstein , a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer . `` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level . Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly %% state %% . '' Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check .
state.n | 2 | On a broader scale , the ruling could encourage other states ' courts to adopt the logic of the New York court , not only in DES cases but in other product-related lawsuits , as well . The New York Court of Appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the California Supreme Court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca n't be determined which company is at fault . Paul Rheingold , a New York lawyer who represents DES victims , said that before the New York ruling , only the %% states %% of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision . Now that the New York decision has been left intact , other states may follow suit . `` Generally , when New York and California go one way , it has a tremendous influence on other states , especially small ones , '' said Mr. Rheingold .
state.n | 2 | But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined . Each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a %% state %% law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension . ( Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz , and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz )
state.n | 1 | All independent media activity is now illegal , which perhaps is not surprising , but so is the manufacture of perfume , cosmetics , household chemicals and sand candles . Medical cooperatives , among the most successful in the U.S.S.R. , are banned from providing general-practitioner services ( their main source of income ) , carrying out surgery , and treating cancer patients , drug addicts and pregnant women . Earlier this month , the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives : The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold ; the second bans cooperatives from buying `` industrial and food goods '' from the %% state %% or other cooperatives . If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market , these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless . Along with some other revealing indicators , these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls , he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought .
state.n | 2 | Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red . `` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland . In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 %% states %% represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs . Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter . Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year .
state.n | 2 | But in 1976 , the court permitted resurrection of such laws , if they meet certain procedural requirements . For instance , juries would have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death . Since that 1976 ruling , 37 %% states %% have reintroduced the death penalty . But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated .
state.n | 2 | `` How do you prove a negative ? '' Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. Boyd explains . At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular %% states %% have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants . Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence . The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling .
state.n | 2 | The law has prevented $ 216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986 , according to William S. Conn , president of the Kentucky Hospital Association . But according to David Jones , Humana 's chief executive , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices . If the Legislature does n't repeal the law , due for revision in 1990 , Mr. Jones says Humana may move its insurance operations , including 3,000 jobs in Louisville , to another %% state %% . The company complains that it paid $ 10 million to non-Humana hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members . But Humana says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped .
state.n | 2 | It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number . Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off . Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced %% state %% spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado . Analysts also say it 's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $ 115 billion foreign debt , on which it suspended interest payments last month . Analysts say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food items .
state.n | 2 | Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare . %% State %% governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills . Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance . But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
state.n | 2 | Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a %% state %% run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
state.n | 3 | It 's all in this handout you do n't want to look at . We could still have a recession '' at some point . One of Mr. Straszheim 's recurring themes is that the %% state %% of the economy is n't a simple black or white . Sometimes , like now , it 's gray . This somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves one Alliance portfolio manager to ask : `` So , what is this -- a Stealth recession ? ''
state.n | 2 | The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits , an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems . But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea , included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients . But first on the list of priorities , says the National Federation of Independent Business , is to prohibit %% state %% laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items , such as psychiatric care , in basic health plans . Such requirements , they argue , make it difficult to provide a basic , low-cost health-benefits package . `` Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered , there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state ; now there are 400 , '' says Carolyn Miller , an NFIB lobbyist .
state.n | 3 | `` They 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar , '' says James Scalfaro , a foreign-exchange marketing representative at Bank of Montreal . While some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen , Mr. Scalfaro and others do n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon . Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak %% state %% after Mr. Lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats . With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies , `` you do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works , says Mike Malpede , senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago . As far as the pound goes , some traders say a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week .
state.n | 2 | The result is that instead of the Pentagon 's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30 . The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees ; meanwhile , lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states . House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) helped secure $ 49.7 million for his %% state %% , or more than double the Pentagon 's budget . West Virginia , home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , would receive $ 21.5 million -- four times the military 's request . Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request .
state.n | 2 | Eastern Municipal Water District , Calif. -- $ 56,565,000 of 1989 certificates of participation ( treatment plant projects ) , via competitive bid . California Health Facilities Financing Authority -- $ 114 million of health facility revenue bonds ( Catholic Healthcare West ) , Series 1989A , via a First Boston Corp. group . Detroit -- $ 130 million of distributable %% state %% aid bonds , via a Chemical Securities Inc. group . Maryland Community Development Administration , Department of Housing and Community Development -- $ 80 million of single-family program bonds , 1989 4th and 5th Series , via a Merrill Lynch group . Matagorda County Navigation District No. 1 , Texas -- $ 70,315,000 of pollution control revenue Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) bonds ( South Texas Project Units No. 1 and 2 ) , via a Goldman Sachs group .
state.n | 2 | How quickly things change . This past summer , investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable . Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices , making %% state %% and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period . But while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value , you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings . Bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
state.n | 2 | Then , by voice vote , the Senate voted a pork-barrel bill , approved Thursday by the House , for domestic military construction . Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves : For construction in West Virginia , Mr. Bush requested $ 4.5 million ; Congress gave Senator Byrd 's %% state %% $ 21.5 million . Senator Byrd is chairman of the Appropriations Committee . For Iowa , a $ 1.8 million request became $ 12 million for Senator Grassley , ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee .
state.n | 2 | His attorney could n't be reached for comment . PRO BONO VOLUNTARISM : In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in New York state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year , the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs . The %% state %% bar association 's policy making body , the House of Delegate , voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar 's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono . `` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester , who headed the bar 's pro bono study committee . DALLAS AND HOUSTON law firms merge : Jackson & Walker , a 130-lawyer firm in Dallas and Datson & Scofield , a 70-lawyer firm in Houston said they have agreed in principle to merge .
state.n | 2 | Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . The number of people receiving %% state %% benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % . Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
state.n | 1 | All the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency , even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built . Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits . %% State %% loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy . However , some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway 's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago . In that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees .
state.n | 1 | Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure Finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation . The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute . After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by %% state %% loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital . But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial condition , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn . People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine .
state.n | 2 | Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has . These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before . A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and getting himself elected to the %% state %% assembly in 1965 . But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame , a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton , was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running . `` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow , '' he said at the time .
state.n | 2 | Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit . By the end of next year , all loss-making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives . Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable %% state %% and collective farms by the end of 1991 . A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly . To mop up some of the 300 billion rubles in circulation , the government should encourage home ownership , including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment .
state.n | 2 | The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom . The charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure . The judge handling the case in %% state %% Supreme Court , a trial court , had tossed out the jury verdicts , ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules . But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that federal law did n't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution . Elizabeth Holtzman , district attorney for Brooklyn , N.Y. , said , `` The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker-safety laws , state prosecutors have the power to protect working people . ''
state.n | 2 | A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges , `` The waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . '' But Hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ 3.95 a day in Texas , while some competitors are charging $ 6.99 . The %% state %% attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices . Flight Attendants Lag Before Jets Even Land IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems a little weary , it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight hours .
state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
state.n | 2 | As expected , First Interstate Bancorp reported a net loss of $ 15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit . The Los Angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank , the result of the %% state %% 's worsening real-estate market . In yesterday 's report , First Interstate said its bank in Texas also reported a loss of $ 23.5 million for the quarter . But it said that its consumer banks in Oregon , California , Nevada and Washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14 % over the year-ago period .
state.n | 2 | Last month , Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press , the commissioner said . The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August . The amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the %% state %% began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 . Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988 , Mr. Kidder added . Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships .
state.n | 2 | The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire 's reorganization . They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire , where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization . Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the %% state %% . The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans . In addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role .
state.n | 3 | Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case . They speak volumes about the %% state %% of our society at a given moment . It has always been so . In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature .
state.n | 2 | But in the months since then , while trying to drum up support for other issues -- such as an anti-flag-burning constitutional amendment -- he has shied away from talking about abortion . What few comments he has initiated have been oblique , such as urging `` greater efforts toward the protection of human life '' at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month . The White House has likewise avoided any involvement in Florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion , which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get %% state %% lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions . The session failed to enact any new curbs . Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape .
state.n | 2 | Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 . Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations . The %% state %% of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . '' Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders . Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years .
state.n | 3 | The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that TW Services , a group of restaurant chains , became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers . The good news -- to fans of stable credit , at least -- is what the rejection says about the %% state %% of mind of junk buyers . Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk . Coniston Partners , which with related entities controls 80 % of TW , had been planning to sell $ 1.15 billion of junk bonds , among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares .
state.n | 2 | The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $ 5.2 billion . Axa has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir James 's investment vehicle , Hoylake Investments Ltd. , for $ 4.5 billion plus a $ 1 billion investment in Hoylake . Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine %% states %% where Farmers operates , and Mr. Bebear 's trip will take him to Idaho , Arizona and New York after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas .
state.n | 2 | Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules . Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects , says Mark Dooling , president of Dooling & Co. , a Newton , Mass. , architectural firm . There is such a maze of federal , %% state %% and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. Dooling says . Taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies . `` It 's very costly and time-consuming , '' says Phil Rosen , a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc. , a Boston car-leasing company .
state.n | 2 | Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president . One %% state %% environmental regulator returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. Maguire says . WITHHOLDING RULES : Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $ 3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small businesses .
state.n | 2 | The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the %% state %% roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry . According to the state department of finance , a one-penny increase in the state 's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $ 3 billion .
state.n | 2 | Willie Brown , speaker of California 's Assembly , said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks . California 's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency . Both Mr. Brown , the %% state %% 's most influential legislator , and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government . According to a spokesman , the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes . Mr. Brown , meanwhile , believes `` only one tax will be feasible , and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said Chuck Dalldorf , an aide .
state.n | 2 | But the fund 's size is disputed by Mr. Brown 's office , which estimates the fund holds from $ 630 million to $ 800 million . Moreover , an aide to Mr. Brown said Gov. Deukmejian `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this . '' To push through a sales tax increase , however , the %% state %% will have to suspend the Gann limit , citing an emergency . And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of the state department of finance . A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature .
state.n | 2 | `` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said Kirk West , president of the California Chamber of Commerce . But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief tab . Since the late 1970s , California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a %% state %% ballot initiative known as Proposition 13 . The state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis .

Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis . To raise more highway funds , a measure to double the state 's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years is set to appear on the %% state %% 's June election ballot . But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure . Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs .
state.n | 2 | Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs . `` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said Quentin Kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee . Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the %% state %% over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .
state.n | 2 | The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year . Also , the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the %% state %% at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average . For example , disaster loans , which will go to small businesses and homeowners , offer credit as low as 4 % in some cases . But the San Francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ 500,000 from $ 100,000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district .
state.n | 1 | The Communists froze prices instead . The farmers ran a boycott , and meat disappeared from the shops . On Aug. 1 , the %% state %% tore up its controls , and food prices leaped . Without buffer stocks , inflation exploded . That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government .
state.n | 1 | `` They ca n't buy feed from the state . There is n't enough . Some %% state %% middlemen come to buy from me . I sell -- a little . I am waiting .
state.n | 1 | They use 60 % more fertilizer per acre , twice the high-grade feed . Yet their best boast is that they produce 32 % of Polish pork . `` I 've heard from friends that %% state %% farms are subsidized , '' Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife , Wieslawa , sets some chairs out in the sun . `` We have one near here . There is a lot of waste .
state.n | 1 | Until recently , a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension . The pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state . His allotment of materials also did , until the %% state %% could n't hold up its end of that bargain . Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines . When supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain .
state.n | 1 | `` Solidarity does n't care for the good of this region , '' he says after a few pleasantries . `` They want to turn everything upside down in a week . Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used at the moment by a %% state %% farm . He ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better . '' `` I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm . ''
state.n | 1 | Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority . Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says its present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland . By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their %% state %% . Unlike the Maronites , Israel 's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut . But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun .
state.n | 2 | When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . New York City : Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern %% states %% . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .
state.n | 2 | That suit is pending . The suits relate to a $ 200 million loss , disclosed in December , that was suffered by West Virginia 's consolidated investment pool . The pool invested idle cash for many %% state %% agencies and local governments . In its suit , the attorney general 's office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer 's office to engage in high-volume , high-risk transactions that benefited the brokers .
state.n | 2 | A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs . Still , Hugo 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes . A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says Hugo has n't prompted proposals for %% state %% or local increases . California , where earthquake damage may top $ 5 billion , plans a special legislative session . Property-tax relief is likely .
state.n | 1 | The State Department said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers . `` If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would be the logical conclusion ? '' Mr. Carmon asked . Israel has long claimed Mr. Arafat never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the Jewish %% state %% . Now , Jerusalem says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat . It blames most of these on Fatah .
state.n | 2 | At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 %% states %% and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
state.n | 2 | These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . Officials in some of these %% states %% say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
state.n | 2 | It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the %% states %% . But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
state.n | 2 | I can see both sides . '' Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue . Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other %% states %% are holding out , he said . Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . '' Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . ''
state.n | 2 | That total would be important for Drexel . The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 %% states %% reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .

There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the %% state %% .

State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , %% state %% securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed ( Drexel ) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
state.n | 2 | A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . '' Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties . Neither state has settled , and officials in the two %% states %% wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago .

While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes Don L. Robinson , associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business organization . Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other %% states %% were defeated . Oregon 's rate will rise to $ 4.75 an hour , the nation 's highest , in Jan. 1 , 1991 . Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .

The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 . In %% states %% that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 . In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year , the same as in 1986 .
state.n | 2 | With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the %% states %% of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia . With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year 's campaign , the Republicans are seen drawing support for their `` Germans First '' stand on social-welfare issues . Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .

state.n | 2 | Exxon Corp. filed suit against the %% state %% of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill . The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies . The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
state.n | 2 | Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the %% state %% for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct . The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
state.n | 2 | Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue . The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' Since the spill last March , Exxon and the %% state %% have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .

Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago . Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's %% state %% of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . '' Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .

state.n | 2 | Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back . However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions . Many %% states %% already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities . These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
state.n | 2 | Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins . But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services . The high court majority said it was up to the %% state %% courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children .

The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , %% states %% and local governments . Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s .

These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for %% state %% unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .
state.n | 2 | So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to %% state %% and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity .

As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications , `` the snooty attorneys for the %% state %% of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree , '' says Mr. Manion . Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .

state.n | 2 | It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the %% state %% is so heavily represented in it ? ( True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . ) Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 { state enterprises } currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .

state.n | 2 | In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances . The bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House . But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for %% state %% governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .

If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .
state.n | 2 | An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) . Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe . Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the %% state %% government level as it does at the federal level . State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse . A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .

state.n | 2 | Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation , employees familiar with the project say . The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings . %% State %% engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse . The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared . Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .
state.n | 2 | The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California , when numerous bridges collapsed . `` We had just finished phase two '' of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state DOT engineer said . After completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last year , the %% state %% DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design . Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets . The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed .

He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
state.n | 2 | `` A lot of donors just get taken . '' Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center . The %% state %% has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs . The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located . Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
state.n | 2 | Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising . %% State %% laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court . It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
state.n | 2 | The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious . California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official . It 's also unclear precisely how the %% state %% will rebuild its reserve , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of California 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated . Meanwhile , new issuance was slow . The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
state.n | 2 | In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase %% state %% revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
state.n | 2 | He added that the Office of Management and Budget , the Transportation Department and other agencies are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon . Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges . California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the %% state %% . Some things ca n't be repaired . The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures .
state.n | 2 | Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow . The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem . Moreover , %% state %% officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours . Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . ''
state.n | 2 | `` But how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question . '' Indeed , abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests . `` The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize , '' says Glen Halva-Neubauer , a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how %% state %% legislators handle the abortion question . `` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . '' The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens .
state.n | 2 | `` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . '' The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens . As a result , GOP %% state %% Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place . The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother . Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .
state.n | 2 | `` Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion , '' Mr. Freind argues , `` it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which , one way or the other , might remain with her for the rest of her life . '' In Michigan , where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week , Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists . Susan Rogin , a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state , takes comfort from the fact that the %% state %% 's House abortion opponents `` have n't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years . '' But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights . In Illinois , lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age , weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that , if fetuses survive an abortion , a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive .
state.n | 2 | At the same time , abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy , deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan , the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development , calls `` reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support . '' These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion . `` Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves ` pro-choice ' rather than ` pro-abortion , ' '' says Mary Spaulding , the group 's associate %% state %% legislative coordinator . Over the weekend , the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians , including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind , as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques , including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures . `` We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time , '' says Kate Michelman , executive director of the group .
state.n | 2 | `` California prices were already coming down . This is n't going to help , '' said Kenneth T. Rosen , chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley . %% State %% housing prices , at a median $ 201,028 , have declined in recent months because of potential buyers ' inability to afford homes . Mr. Rosen , among others , suggested that the quake , the strongest since the 1906 temblor that struck San Francisco , will in the short term create a two-tier price system for quake-prone communities , with dwellings built on sturdy ground likely to demand higher prices . One San Francisco neighborhood likely to test Mr. Rosen 's theory soon is the city 's fashionable Marina district , which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state .
state.n | 2 | As the music swells , viewers discover they 're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer , the pride of Texas , a product of G. Heileman Brewing Co. , a La Crosse , Wis. , unit of Bond Corp . As the ad 's tone implies , the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days , and Lone Star is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that . From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the %% state %% has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders . While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times . That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .
state.n | 2 | Not exactly sophisticated market research , but who cares as long as the campaigns work . And ad agencies insist that they do . Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc. , Dallas , tells of the Texan who saw the agency 's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the %% state %% 's anthem -- and promptly invested $ 100,000 in the thrift 's CDs . Never mind that First Gibraltar is one of the failed Texas thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case , an investor group headed by New York financier Ronald Perelman . The North Texas Chevy Dealers recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite Easterners .
state.n | 1 | FileNet Corp. , Costa Mesa , Calif. , said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $ 1.8 million , or 17 cents a share , because of a $ 2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California . Revenue is estimated at $ 18.6 million . The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of %% state %% uniform commercial code division . FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute . The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet system installed earlier this year .
state.n | 1 | But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map . Which is what the Old Guard fears . `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable %% state %% , '' says Michael Simmons , a British journalist whose book on East Germany , entitled `` The Unloved Country , '' was published this month . Up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy , followed by Mr. Honecker 's campaign to build the East bloc 's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise . Neither man achieved perfection .
state.n | 2 | Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually . The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S. , including income taxes . At the %% state %% and local level , the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate , inheritance and gift taxes , but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest .
state.n | 2 | Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage . Highways , such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland , generally do n't have insurance coverage . Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage , either , so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of %% state %% general operating funds . However , the bridge , which charges a $ 1 toll each way , does have `` loss of income '' insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days . That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman 's Fund Corp. , based in Novato , Calif. , and Cigna Corp. , based in Philadelphia .
state.n | 2 | But he says that 's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars . Opponents do n't buy such arguments . `` Human nature being what it is , people do n't always follow instructions , '' says Jack Guzewich , chief of food protection for the New York %% state %% Health Department . Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg Producers . The Decatur , Ga. , trade group has issued a `` briefing book '' that claims the machine is `` a health hazard '' and that Mr. Maynard is trying `` to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers . ''
state.n | 2 | `` It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget . '' The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area , serving 5,000 people . Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other %% states %% . All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA , agency officials said . And in the confusion after the earthquake , `` the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area , '' said Carl Suchocki , a FEMA spokesman .
state.n | 2 | The account currently has $ 220 million . And though federal law dictates that only $ 100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster , administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California . To get that money , %% states %% must go through an elaborate approval process , but officials expect red tape to be cut this time . Keith Mulrooney , special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson , also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California , the state set tougher standards for bridges , and with federal aid , began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards . The first phase of the program has been completed , but two other phases are continuing .
state.n | 2 | NEW YORK 'S poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help . That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association . The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the %% state %% , a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field . `` The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions , '' said Joseph Genova , chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank , Tweed , Hadley & McCloy . According to the study , slightly more than 34 % of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help .
state.n | 2 | He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices . But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase Next 's sales on campuses . `` From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology , this is a step backward , '' said Jerry W. Sprecher , a senior computing manager for the California %% state %% university system . `` But it will definitely boost Next 's sales . '' Universities , however , say Next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine .
state.n | 2 | `` This project is ready to move , '' said State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese . But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain . As part of the agreement with the %% state %% , the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending . Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $ 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs . Also , he said , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will be appealed .
state.n | 2 | `` It 's known they need the sugar , and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support , '' the dealer said . LIVESTOCK AND MEATS : The Agriculture Department is expected to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the 13 major ranch %% states %% slipped 4 % to 8.21 million on Oct. 1 compared with the level a year earlier , said Tom Morgan , president of Sterling Research Corp. , Arlington Heights , Ill . Cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government 's quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef . Among other things , the government is expected to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter slipped 3 % .
state.n | 1 | But East Germany is merely `` the land of truly existing socialism . '' Beyond that , it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity . Up to now , the main weapon of the `` worker and peasant %% state %% '' has been the ideology of socialism . With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany , East Germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league . Without Moscow 's military and party behind it , East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating .
state.n | 2 | Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside . But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below . Officials of the %% state %% agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up . Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $ 55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake . Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work .
state.n | 2 | Mr. Taylor 's overwhelming victory against Republican Tom Anderson reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special House elections held this year . Mr. Taylor , a 36-year-old state senator from Bay St. Louis , won 65 % of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott . Mr. Taylor 's victory was an embarrassment for both %% state %% and national Republicans . Mr. Anderson , a former Lott aide , received campaign assistance from the senator and from President Bush , who visited the district last week . Even so , Mr. Taylor carried all but one of the district 's dozen counties .
state.n | 2 | The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity . Yesterday , four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24 . The elections will be held in different %% states %% on one of the two days . ( The lower house 's five-year term expires in January ; the Parliament 's upper house is appointed . ) The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress ( I ) , which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India 's 42 years of independence .
state.n | 2 | Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians . For harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates . The state of California , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in %% state %% parks to mountain bicycles . The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles . Most other states have enacted similar bans .
state.n | 1 | Not all Poles are pleased . `` What do we want casinos for when we have n't got anything in the shops ? '' one housewife asked . But Bogdan Gumkowski , who runs the casino at Warsaw 's Marriott Hotel , said the ventures would help Poland service its $ 39 billion foreign debt by pouring dollars into the %% state %% firms in the joint ventures -- the LOT airline and Orbis tourist organization . Algeria plans to increase natural-gas sales to Europe and the U.S. . According to the Middle East Economic Survey , the North African nation is holding talks with Italy for adding a fourth pipe to a section of the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline , expanding capacity by up to six billion cubic meters a year from 12.5 billion .
state.n | 2 | The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book value of the collection { be } reduced to zero . '' In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . The %% state %% obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . '' The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's `` furniture and fixtures , '' were actually hanging in the chairman 's house . Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's .

Meanwhile , President Kume ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go `` town watching , '' to visit chic parts of Tokyo to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend-setters .
system.n | 1 | Many thanks for Alexander Cockburn 's comic masterpiece ( `` U.S. . Economy : A House Built on Junk-Bond Sand , '' Viewpoint , Oct. 19 ) . The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the U.S. economic %% system %% was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn 's satirical muse . I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in . It should be a scream .
system.n | 2 | Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp . The closely held Sunnyvale , Calif. , company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp. , which will sell Mips machines under its own label . The new Mips machine , called the RC6280 , will cost $ 150,000 for a basic %% system %% . The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors . The machine employs reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , technology .
system.n | 2 | Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo 's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds , making them surrogate parents . The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing\/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T . Using Gnu-Emacs , the spy could substitute a bogus `` atrun '' program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix %% system %% every five minutes . Once his cuckoo 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` super-user , '' with access to everything . Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab 's computers .
system.n | 2 | The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets . When the hacker moved , Mr. Stoll moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion . Sometimes , if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the %% system %% down to frustrate his quarry . The FBI initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape . The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage .
system.n | 2 | Fujitsu Ltd. said it wants to withdraw its controversial one-yen bid to design a waterworks computer %% system %% for the city of Hiroshima . Meanwhile , Japan 's Fair Trade Commission said it was considering launching an investigation into whether the bid , the equivalent of less than a penny , violates anti-monopoly laws . Hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor , expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project .

Southern Air Transport Inc. won $ 47.5 million in Air Force and Navy contracts for transportation services . International Business Machines Corp. was given a $ 31.2 million Air Force contract for satellite data systems equipment .
system.n | 4 | After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care %% system %% , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats . Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year .
system.n | 4 | The pressure for change will rise with costs . `` I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change , '' says Sharon Canner , a health expert at NAM . Any major attempt to revamp the health-care %% system %% is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups , particularly the American Medical Association , and perhaps from the public as well , if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care . The NAM embraces efforts , which both the administration and the medical profession have begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines . Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures .
system.n | 1 | The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination . The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of ( New York 's ) unlawful employment practices . '' Justice Rubin , a state judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court %% system %% because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number . The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
system.n | 2 | While most American employees have their own private space , Japanese `` salarymen '' usually share large , common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact . Top Japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations . And Japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single , integrated computer %% system %% corporatewide . Besides , a computer processing the Japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols . Until recently , much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable .
system.n | 2 | But the U.S. companies are redoubling their efforts . Apple recently hired its first Japanese president , luring away an official of Toshiba 's European operations , as well as a whole Japanese top-management team . Earlier this year , it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating %% system %% and a kanji laser printer . IBM just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both Japanese and English and that substantially enhances compatibility with its American products . `` It may take five years to break even in Japan , '' says John A. Siniscal , who runs the Asia-Pacific office for McCormack & Dodge , a U.S. software company .
system.n | 1 | This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and `` harmonic '' society . The key to the creation of the `` organic '' state lay in the formation of `` natural '' groups that would undertake the role of decision-making . By contrast , a parliamentary %% system %% based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause , rather than resolve , conflict . The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress . In doing so , he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market .
system.n | 1 | We keep wondering what Mr. Gates wanted to say . Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev 's need for `` a stable currency , free and competitive markets , private property and real prices '' and other pie-in-the-sky reforms . Perhaps he 'd have called for `` a decentralized political and economic %% system %% '' without a dominant communist party . Or political arrangements `` to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics . '' Why , a Bob Gates might even have said , `` Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits . ''
system.n | 1 | Where they lag behind the Japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production . By contrast , the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions . Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own %% system %% . Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets . In 1991 , the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space , the first Japanese to go into orbit .
system.n | 4 | Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . '' The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets . A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking %% system %% . And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault .
system.n | 2 | E.W. Scripps Co. said it has acquired a Georgia cable television company and a Massachusetts publishing firm . Terms on both deals were n't disclosed . The media company said it purchased Cable USA Inc. , a privately held cable television %% system %% in Carroll County , Ga. , a suburb of Atlanta . The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes . The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc. , a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton , Mass .
system.n | 2 | In addition , Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ 100 million during the quarter , leaving it within $ 100 million of its goal of a reduction of $ 500 million by the end of the year . Still , Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter , a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters . The company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the Unix operating %% system %% . That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines . In addition , Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .

Westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co . `` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says Theodore Stern , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility %% systems %% group . At the same time , Westinghouse hopes its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the U.S. , from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG , Siemens AG , and British General Electric Co . Under the agreement , Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .

Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges , the industry and ultimately the general public . One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a %% system %% that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker . The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill . We would be delighted to have such a system in place today .

Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment %% system %% on which property taxes are based .

Alongside the current non-convertible ruble , a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies . A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking %% system %% . The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans : the State Planning Committee , known as Gosplan , and the State Committee for Material Supply , or Gossnab . But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes , particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies , take effect .
system.n | 1 | The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain . Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation . But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both %% systems %% . As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent . I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .

One of those new computers , called Sparcstation 1 , accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter , he said . More than two-thirds of the %% systems %% shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in April . But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer . These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $ 20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30 .

So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market .
system.n | 3 | The incident occurred Saturday night . The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting . Scientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune %% system %% , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. said . The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells .

system.n | 1 | In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . In the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . 3 . Decide whether you want a panel %% system %% or a single adjudicator . A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy .
system.n | 1 | 4 . Make your due-process system visible . It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it . Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process %% systems %% for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .
system.n | 4 | Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport %% system %% , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates . `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
system.n | 2 | New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV %% system %% . However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million . The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
system.n | 2 | NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones & Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases . An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the information . Some organizations have devised their own %% systems %% to sort through news wire items as they come in . George Goodwin , an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada , adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called Agenda to sort through international news wires . It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas .
system.n | 1 | And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made ( at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators ) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias 's agenda . Prior to this episode , Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn. ) , sensing an open field , undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels . Visiting Nicaragua , he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral %% system %% and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas . In Honduras , where the Contras are a hot political issue , he promised to help unblock some $ 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington . Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani ; Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes .
system.n | 2 | When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading %% system %% should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors . Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
system.n | 1 | The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury . BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking %% system %% , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .

Beginning as a laborer in a refinery , Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago . Though he also long benefited from the %% system %% built by La Quina , Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand . They are `` at the base of all of the problems of corruption , '' he says . Thus , in recent contract negotiations , Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union 's right to assign 40 % of all of Pemex 's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks .
system.n | 2 | Storage Technology Corp. had net income of $ 8.3 million , or 32 cents a share , for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29 , almost 15 times the $ 557,000 , or two cents a share , it posted for the year-ago period . Storage , Louisville , Colo. , which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers , said the huge increase in net reflects `` strong sales '' of its tape products , particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System , which holds a library of tape cartridges . The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge %% system %% , which cost $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 each . Quarter revenue was $ 232.6 million , up 12 % from $ 206 million last year . The stock market reacted strongly to the news .
system.n | 2 | The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology . IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 to make laser-read optical products . But the partners did n't believe the market for the %% systems %% was developing as rapidly as they had hoped . After reportedly investing $ 100 million in the business , Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based Pioneer , among others . Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks , audio disk players , videodisks and videodisk players .
system.n | 2 | The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division . FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute . The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet %% system %% installed earlier this year . State officials could n't be reached for comment late yesterday . FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling $ 22.5 million on Sept. 30 , and stockholders ' equity is $ 60.1 million .
system.n | 4 | `` Obviously , things are going to have to go on hold for many companies . '' The damage to the Bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship . A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day , far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit %% system %% ( BART ) -- which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks . California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area . All major roadways except Interstate 880 , known as the Nimitz Freeway , and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday .
system.n | 2 | Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities . They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo . Other airlines would have access to the %% system %% , they said , and negotiations with partners were already under way . Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck . They currently have large orders for cargo planes .
system.n | 2 | Meanwhile , several other major installations around the Valley -- America 's center of high-tech -- said they , too , fared as well as could be expected . Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where the Energy Department tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons , had only `` superficial damage , '' a spokesman said . At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space %% systems %% group in Sunnyvale , about 40 miles south of San Francisco , workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that `` there were no show-stoppers '' in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus . Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling , but `` the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape , '' an official said . One of Lockheed 's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's $ 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile .
system.n | 4 | `` NASA did it right ; that 's the message , '' said J.R. Thompson , the agency 's deputy administrator . The $ 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons . If all goes well , it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar %% system %% was formed 4.6 billion years ago . Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape . Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth , but these planets are lifeless ; Earth , on the other hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .
system.n | 4 | Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston . As you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System . The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the %% system %% by enacting `` The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989 . '' This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support . Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development .

Bankers Trust uses Digital 's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts , juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day , he says . As that %% system %% grows , larger computers may be needed . `` In the past , customers had to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX . Now they do n't have to , '' he says .
system.n | 2 | While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton , Calif. ; Reno and Las Vegas , Nev. ; and Los Angeles . United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area . A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler %% system %% was triggered by the tremors . The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport ; in fact , as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night , two babies were born . Yesterday , the United ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
system.n | 2 | Loral Corp. said it received a $ 325 million order from Turkey 's Ministry of Defense , the largest contract the company ever has received . Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures %% system %% for its fleet of F-16 aircraft . The system provides radar-threat warning and electronic jamming capabilities . The defense electronics maker said delivery will begin in October 1991 and run through mid-1995 .
system.n | 2 | Commercial customers can purchase the same system through Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer based in San Jose , Calif. , for roughly $ 3,000 more . Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device , which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals . Another factor was that customers were asking , `` Why do n't you give us a cheaper %% system %% ? '' Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here . Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer . But the technology , while reliable , is far slower than the widely used hard drives .

WYSE TECHNOLOGY INC. , San Jose , maker of video display terminals and workstations and IBM\/PC compatible computers , annual sales of $ 452 million , slight structural damage at headquarters , no injuries , expects to be back to full operation today . 3COM CORP. , Santa Clara , maker of computer communications %% systems %% , annual sales of $ 386 million , OTC , slight structural damage to headquarters , communications systems already fully operational .
system.n | 2 | Microsoft 's stock rose $ 2.875 a share in national over-the-counter trading to $ 78.625 . The stock had hit a high of $ 81 a share early last week but collapsed to $ 73.50 in the Friday stock plunge . The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications , which have lower margins than do operating %% systems %% . But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing . As a result , Microsoft 's cost of goods , as a percentage of sales , fell 17 % from the year-ago quarter and 13 % from the previous period .
system.n | 2 | Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases . It was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. , a San Antonio , Texas-based data-processing %% systems %% maker . Intelogic Trace , a computer services company , was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985 , after Mr. Edelman gained control . After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman , the corporate raider purchased 30 % of Datapoint 's shares .
system.n | 2 | The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe , which is to be launched today . Charles Redmond , a NASA spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today . Although the network is n't connected to the computer %% systems %% that operate either Galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn . Mr. Redmond said the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` garbage data could be substituted for real data . '' He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system .
system.n | 2 | A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks . The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network , Mr. Redmond said . NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their %% systems %% to reject worms . But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . Michael Alexander , a senior editor at Computerworld , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name .
system.n | 2 | In Beijing , meantime , China opened an international aviation show , but the West 's embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the nation 's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away . Officials said 91 companies from 14 countries , including the U.S. , had displays , down from about 260 firms from more than 20 countries at the last show in Japanese air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined two million yen ( $ 14,000 ) for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile-guidance %% systems %% . A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence . Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin 's `` responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan . ''
system.n | 1 | Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . '' Jeffrey Nichols , president of APMS Canada , Toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal . `` Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the { Federal Reserve } in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial %% system %% , which helped the stock market rebound on Monday , '' he said . There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold , he said . `` They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. Nichols said .
system.n | 1 | The environment can no longer be a normal issue , to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change . We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere . This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic %% systems %% . The problems of the environment are so interrelated , so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years . The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes .

Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis , by company tradition . Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering %% systems %% . The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs . Sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ 1.79 billion , from $ 1.65 billion , with all three major product groups reporting gains .

system.n | 2 | `` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel . Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations . The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer %% system %% . The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses . So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well .
turn.v | 2 | Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control %% turn %% malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .

His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor . Dr. Vogelstein next %% turned %% his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer . He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring .

One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed , while another helps support the family with money siphoned from crime . The real tragedy , though , lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances .

Of like , though lesser , note , Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so . And , last but not least , President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and believes that Mr. Krenz `` ca n't %% turn %% the clock back '' in East Germany because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told the New York Times 's R.W.

'' The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division . Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have %% turned %% down the offer . News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .

The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly %% turn %% over the product , thus increasing volatility . But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . '' The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets , and index options on the CBOE -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings .
turn.v | 11 | The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents . Last November , a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract . The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that should n't be %% turned %% over to prosecutors . A hearing is scheduled on the issue today . The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts .

While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use . Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been %% turned %% into one . Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908 , the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations . When the Germans lost World War I , they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer , patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers .

The state agency , which usually publishes the data on monthly basis , but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months , said the advance was led by output of consumer goods , which rose 3.5 % from June and was up 7.2 % from a year earlier . Semifinished goods %% turned %% in a strong showing , with a monthly rise of 2 % and a year-on-year advance of 3 % . Food production was ahead 1.7 % from June and 5.3 % from a year earlier .

turn.v | 5 | At Movieline , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . '' In restaurants ( in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres ) , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room . `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you %% turn %% it off ? '' That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) .
turn.v | 3 | Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from Goodson Newspaper Group Inc . As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has %% turned %% increasingly bitter recently . Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 .
turn.v | 11 | And Friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment . Thus , even including the latest week , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % so far this year , the Lipper Analytical figures show . By comparison , global asset allocation funds have %% turned %% in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 % . Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average . `` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. Brouwer .
turn.v | 5 | Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops . Once activated , the card would sit in the car 's window , showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain . When the motorist returned to his car he could %% turn %% the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later . Seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology . Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service .
turn.v | 4 | There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while %% turning %% away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .
turn.v | 4 | Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian , payments investors were never told about , the attorney general alleged . Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted . In practice , the attorney general alleged in an affidavit , if an investor had access to cash `` the chances of being %% turned %% down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club . '' And , the attorney general added , First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed himself as a `` financial expert '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth . First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general .
turn.v | 1 | Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , %% turning %% upward and threatening to fuel inflation . Trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport . Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
turn.v | 1 | The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary would n't know how to handle money . '' Back at the Verwoerd house , Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr . The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no %% turning %% back the integration of South African society and politics , Morgenzon will boom . `` We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . `` By populating a place now , we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account . ''
turn.v | 4 | The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things , just as Noriega had helped { the U.S. . } the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal . '' Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams , who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz . Mr. Noriega 's proposal was %% turned %% down . And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image . The end of the marriage was at hand .
turn.v | 2 | What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks . They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships . Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in the 1970s , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place %% turning %% people 's hair white . Gives me the willies just thinking about it . Mr. Lehman , a Reagan Navy secretary , is a managing director of PaineWebber .
turn.v | 4 | Flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air . The distracted Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person . At last her lawyer , Arthur D. Cloud , gave up the case because she %% turned %% down three successive settlements he arranged . Cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client : `` I wanted to be a lawyer , and Mrs. Wright wanted me to be an avenging angel . So I got out .
turn.v | 6 | After casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford 's introduction as an illustration . He begins : `` At one time it seemed as if the Soviet Union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations . As things %% turned %% out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson : instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at the moment . Such activity may or may not have irritated the Kremlin , but it has frequently condemned America to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world . The defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` goodness '' or `` badness '' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves .
turn.v | 1 | Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? ? Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ? For answers to such questions we must %% turn %% to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists . Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap heap . False ideas surfeit another sector of our life .
turn.v | 2 | Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect . In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of %% turning %% into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .
turn.v | 1 | Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; ; the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet can not feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that %% turns %% a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the sum is nothing . And yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .
turn.v | 1 | A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again . If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses ' feet returned no more . When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster 's cart might %% turn %% the corner . The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees . Sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today '' ! !
turn.v | 1 | Again , the composer must select his own materials . But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials . Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have %% turned %% to similar approaches . Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation . According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' .
turn.v | 1 | Was it all vain labor ? ? Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ? ? Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren %% turned %% back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down . Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait . If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself .
turn.v | 1 | They were far off and looked tiny . The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them . They %% turned %% at the bottom of Kate 's steps and moved off in the direction of the park . He thought he saw -- it awakened and , for a moment , interested him -- that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash . Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed .
turn.v | 6 | Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others . We blushed and were flustered , and it %% turned %% out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek . The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me . It was at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New Year 's Eve with me .
turn.v | 1 | She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . She had begun to %% turn %% back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
turn.v | 2 | Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach . He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet . Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was %% turning %% pasty , sticking to the kid 's back and behind . `` Ai n't he going to wake up '' ? ? `` What about your pa '' ? ?
turn.v | 1 | The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air . He %% turned %% from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` Remember the Starbird ? ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .
turn.v | 1 | Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later . He had peered through the darkness at the rampart . The men he would take back across the river stood there , but he %% turned %% away from them . He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt . He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .
turn.v | 1 | Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff . The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side . Watson %% turned %% away , sickened for the first time in many months . He heard the patient voice calling . -- Henry ? ?
turn.v | 1 | I stiffened . Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog 's that is going to get into a fight . I %% turned %% around with the percolator in my hand . My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora . Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .
turn.v | 5 | In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen . She was intimidated by the stove . He found the pilot light and %% turned %% on one of the burners for her . The gas flamed up two inches high . They found the teakettle .
turn.v | 1 | His heart suddenly opened to joy . He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . If Simms Purdew would %% turn %% to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened . Lemme tell you now '' -- If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told . It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand .
turn.v | 1 | Only one worth a shit , and that 's Brandon . He ai n't so bad . His thoughts %% turned %% to other things . The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for . Kaboom for .
turn.v | 1 | He meandered down Pike Street , past the First National Bank with its green window shades . He crossed the tracks to Delaware House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah . A tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , %% turned %% insolent green eyes upon him . She was taller than Aggie . She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked .
turn.v | 1 | The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife . Perhaps it was right ; ; perhaps it was just . He had dared to defy nature , to %% turn %% his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished . Like Mrs. Dalloway , with her regrets about Peter Walsh , he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent . If he had had a son , he would tell him , `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying '' .
turn.v | 4 | You shouldn't have tried to . Oh , you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself . But , I 'm telling you , it 'll be %% turned %% down -- you don't understand the System yet . The Martians have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can't touch him . They run their show their way -- the Universe has variety , something for everybody -- a fact you field workers often miss '' .
turn.v | 1 | When he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on Shayol : `` Standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes . Good luck , fellow '' . Mercer %% turned %% away . The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat . What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
turn.v | 1 | It would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed . Secretary Hart had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters ; ; but there was no small way to handle this one . He %% turned %% back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips . But he was too late . He had lost his audience .
turn.v | 1 | He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had n't meant what he had believed it had . He felt unutterably weary . Dean %% turned %% from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms . He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness . She too began to weep .
turn.v | 1 | in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear . The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow . When they %% turned %% in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line . The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind . The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin 's stallion .
turn.v | 1 | The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family . The haughty white girl %% turned %% to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier . It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' . Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .
turn.v | 1 | `` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder . `` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record . And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to %% turn %% around before you drown yourself . So you turn around '' . `` No , it was n't that '' , Rob said .
turn.v | 1 | `` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ? `` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said . Waddell %% turned %% to face him . `` No '' ? ? He asked . `` But that 's what he told me .
turn.v | 1 | The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man . He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows . He %% turned %% and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes . He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster . `` He 's dead , is n't he '' ? ? The man said .
turn.v | 1 | Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man . Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey . It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman %% turn %% and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .
turn.v | 6 | In a way , he could n't blame her . He had picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon . It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it %% turned %% out . It was n't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her . She had hated the whole idea before they started .
turn.v | 2 | Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones . The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake . Their world %% turned %% black . It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .
turn.v | 6 | I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there . When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted . The arrangement %% turned %% out to be excellent . I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras . I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner .
turn.v | 1 | Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host 's daughters . I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass . Then I saw the father 's head slightly %% turn %% ; ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold . Autos whizzed past . White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .
turn.v | 5 | Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy . The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom . Greg slapped his hand across the switches that %% turned %% on the guns and gun camera and gun sight . The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him . His hands shook .
turn.v | 12 | Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them . No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp %% turned %% in for a night of sound sleep . For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night . Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains .
turn.v | 1 | `` Eagle 's Nest ought to have a fire company . If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack '' . He started toward the stairway , then %% turned %% to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams 's room , that Adams is in trouble . Tell her to hurry '' . `` Yes sir '' .
turn.v | 6 | Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . But that indictment was never made . For Tom Horn , it %% turned %% out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing . The former scout 's alibi could n't be shaken . The authorities had to release him .
turn.v | 1 | She had offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` Auntie '' . When they reached their neighbor 's house , Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again . Then she %% turned %% the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination . As she drove , she thought about her plan . It was really quite simple .
turn.v | 1 | The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts . Five miles . In a small grove against the river they halted , %% turning %% deep into the protection of the trees . Foster had brought extra clothing also . A good man , Emmett .
turn.v | 5 | Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person . With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air . When he saw me coming he %% turned %% his radio off . He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf . He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance .
turn.v | 1 | If you were a man '' -- `` She is n't , mister '' . The voice came from behind him , and Wilson %% turned %% . The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees . But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .
turn.v | 1 | Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts . None of them reached our walls again . The few survivors grudgingly %% turned %% away . In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .
turn.v | 2 | When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures . `` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said . `` We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and %% turn %% the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that '' . `` What else '' ? ? `` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
turn.v | 1 | Dolores stood motionless in the doorway . He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts . Martin %% turned %% his back . He strode to answer the bell . Bill 's hat was deposited in the hall closet .
turn.v | 1 | He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had %% turned %% at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .
turn.v | 1 | I 'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . This letter would have got to me if she had n't even put Rome , Italy , on it . She refolded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and %% turned %% with relief to one from her brother George . But alas George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec 's funeral . He was full of heavy family reminiscence .
turn.v | 6 | At least , we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was . I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . Especially in the way Gladdy had %% turned %% out . Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it was n't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . But I must n't start on Alice .
turn.v | 1 | `` Hey '' ! ! Her voice was flat and dull . But those penetrating eyes -- I had to %% turn %% my head away . It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed . There were bloodspots on the sheet .
turn.v | 5 | He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to . Fearless . Every night when he wanted a drink of water , did n't he practice being fearless by not %% turning %% on the bathroom light ? ? A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he 'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I 'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad . He had n't intended to make the promise .
turn.v | 6 | `` Yes , I thought you 'd probably be up . Look , sweetheart , some fool was . Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night . Unfortunately it %% turned %% out to be me , but I would n't quite put it that way to the boss . Oh hell no , I 'm not in a hospital . I wo n't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there 's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon .
turn.v | 3 | And Early Spring seized the whip and said : `` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter . Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! ! But the old man %% turned %% on her , jerking the whip from her hand . `` Get into your hovel '' ! ! He spat . `` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
turn.v | 1 | She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little . `` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ? `` Me '' ? ? She asked , %% turning %% slowly . `` What about me '' ? ? `` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
turn.v | 1 | The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee . Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal . She would %% turn %% to them , then turn to him , then turn again . Watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth . Signora Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest .
turn.v | 1 | Devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland . But Carla 's eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness . And Carla , watching in wonder , %% turned %% to Sam . `` It means so much to her . It 's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone .
turn.v | 1 | No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . She haunted me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country . `` We all feel guilty '' , I %% turned %% away from her coldly . `` It was nobody 's fault . She overplayed her hand '' .
turn.v | 5 | And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he could n't afford and the too-shiny shoes . You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? ? It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you could n't have Gratt Shafer ; ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to %% turn %% on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy . It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer 's substitute , that other guy . And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .
turn.v | 4 | They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' . I was amazed . You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to %% turn %% yourself out of your own home . You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal . And I was n't .
turn.v | 5 | Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different . `` Harro , girl-san '' ! ! He said , %% turning %% on what was meant to be charm . `` You catchee boy-furiendo ? ? Maybe you likee date with me '' ? ?
turn.v | 2 | Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let 's resume our catalogue . Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to %% turn %% your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though -- Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea .

The rhinos would panic , screaming help ! ! -- if that can be screamed in their language '' . `` You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ? Moreland demanded .
turn.v | 2 | Perhaps that was the first thing to do . A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , %% turn %% into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .
value.n | 1 | Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking . The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with that , let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations . They are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little %% value %% in educating anyone about the issues in dispute . The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics . Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews .
value.n | 2 | The size of the issue was scaled back from an originally planned $ 350 million . The first part , consisting of $ 151 million of 13 3\/4 % senior subordinated reset notes , was priced at 99.75 . The rate on the notes will be reset annually to give the issue a market %% value %% of 101 . However , the maximum coupon at which the notes can be reset is 16 1\/4 % . The minimum coupon is 13 3\/4 % .
value.n | 2 | Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford defended the Treasury 's efforts this fall to drive down the %% value %% of the dollar , saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market Oct. 13 . Testifying before a House subcommittee , Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have `` unhinged financial markets . '' Mr. Mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . ''
value.n | 2 | FOREIGN PRIME RATES : Canada 13.50 % ; Germany 9 % ; Japan 4.875 % ; Switzerland 8.50 % ; Britain 15 % . These rate indications are n't directly comparable ; lending practices vary widely by location . TREASURY BILLS : Results of the Monday , October 30 , 1989 , auction of short-term U.S. government bills , sold at a discount from face %% value %% in units of $ 10,000 to $ 1 million : 7.78 % 13 weeks ; 7.62 % 26 weeks . FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP .

value.n | 1 | Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year . Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake , Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy . Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and %% value %% , '' said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd . In a statement , the company said : `` Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies . The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . ''
value.n | 2 | Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton . LTV 's planned increase , which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate . LTV confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the %% value %% of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities . A spokesman for LTV Steel , which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp. , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased only 1.7 % between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much . At the same time , steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive .
value.n | 2 | And why should holders expect to realize that presumed `` worth ? '' That was another reason the Street loved Santa Fe . With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell 's Itel owning close to 40 % of Santa Fe 's stock , management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize %% values %% . '' But value , it turns out , is only what a buyer will pay . And with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate , the values suddenly look poorer .
value.n | 2 | Santa Fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20 % interest in its real estate unit to the California Public Employees Retirement System for roughly $ 400 million . Since the real estate unit also includes debt , the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to $ 3 billion . `` The implied current net asset %% value %% of 22.70 { per share } is well below the 30 level that the Street believed , '' PaineWebber says . `` The upside was in the intangible real estate ... which is no longer an intangible . '' So what is Santa Fe worth ?
value.n | 2 | And what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? '' Some analysts remain bullish . Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` %% values %% '' of 30 a share . He adds : `` If for any reason I do n't have the values , then I wo n't recommend it . '' First Boston 's Graeme Anne Lidgerwood values Santa Fe at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 .
value.n | 2 | Florida National said yesterday that it remains committed to the merger . Dycom Industries gained 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 after it said it agreed to buy Ansco & Associates and two affiliates for cash and stock . The %% value %% of the transaction was n't disclosed . The companies being acquired provide telecommunications services to the telephone industry . Willamette Industries , whose stock has suffered steep losses in recent sessions , surged 1 1\/2 to 49 .
value.n | 2 | Walter Kirchberger , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that offering holders a higher , $ 70-a-share price is `` a fairly effective method of blocking '' the Stena-Tiphook bid . Michael Carstens , an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day , added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses . For holders who decide not to tender their shares , Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated %% value %% of $ 25 , plus a cash dividend on the common stock . The company said its directors , management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and wo n't tender any of their shares under the offer . Sea Containers said the offer will proceed after the Bermuda Supreme Court lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares .
value.n | 2 | G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy . Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand . But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose %% value %% rises when interest rates decline . Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen . `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
value.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas , the %% value %% of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
value.n | 3 | That 's 115 % more than in 1981 . Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences . It reflects %% values %% of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says John H. Moxley III , who directs physician-executive searches for Korn\/Ferry International . `` This is a change in the social fabric of medicine , '' he says . Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills
value.n | 2 | The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $ 2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday . Here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face %% value %% . Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
value.n | 2 | McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause . Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices . To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term %% value %% of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer . `` We 're very pleased with the new deal . We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , which holds 500,000 LIN shares .
value.n | 2 | Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November . But approval is almost certain since Mr. Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control . After the transaction , Mr. Rey estimates the %% value %% of his 20 % stake in the new company , to be held by his Omni Holding AG , will be about 1 billion Swiss francs . This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs . Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982 , building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions .
value.n | 2 | After days of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt 's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation . Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks . If the case is converted to Chapter 7 , what remains of the oil tycoon 's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a %% value %% of less than $ 125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service , whose claim for $ 300 million in back taxes has priority in the case . Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing , according to attorneys involved . While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .
value.n | 2 | Additionally , Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ 175.5 million , or $ 13.44 a share , compared with net income of $ 27.1 million , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago . A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ 143.6 million of goodwill . The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and , consequently , to write down the asset %% value %% of some previous acquisitions . Crossland recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter . Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35.6 million from $ 70.1 million a year ago .
value.n | 1 | For instance , employment in Denver will be reduced to 105 from 430 . But on the West Coast , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the Bakersfield , Calif. , office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305 . The reorganization will `` focus on the %% value %% and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said .
value.n | 2 | Jim Pattison Industries Ltd. , one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur James Pattison , said it `` intends to seek control '' of 30%-owned Innopac Inc. , a Toronto packaging concern . Jim Pattison Industries , a holding company with annual sales of about C$ 1.9 billion , largely from car dealerships and grocery stores , did n't elaborate on the statement , and a company official declined further comment . The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of Innopac 's 13.8 million common shares outstanding , which have an aggregate market %% value %% of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 117.3 million ) . Separately , Innopac reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents a share , reflecting inventory write-downs . The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year .
value.n | 2 | Leaseway said it has begun discussions with certain institutional debt holders to review the proposed private placement transaction , which would exchange the debt for new subordinated debt instruments and equity securities . Specific terms are subject to review and a final agreement with debt holders , the company said . But the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face %% value %% and reduced cash interest . Also , debt holders would be offered an equity position in Leaseway , which in total would represent a controlling interest in the company . Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is the adviser on the transaction .

TREASURY BILLS : Results of the Monday , October 23 , 1989 , auction of short-term U.S. government bills , sold at a discount from face %% value %% in units of $ 10,000 to $ 1 million : 7.52 % 13 weeks ; 7.50 % 26 weeks .

value.n | 2 | In March , American Medical received a $ 24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder M. Lee Pearce . It also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price . A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder %% value %% . The following month , the company put itself up for sale . It received more offers , but the auction was surprisingly won by IMA , which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. Gilleland to stay on as an equity participant .
value.n | 2 | Analysts said the move could presage even harsher action by the banks . But any move by the banks to take over Qintex Australia 's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under Australian broadcast license rules . That , in turn , could substantially reduce the %% value %% of the television assets . The appointment of Peat Marwick , which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies , came about as a result of a round of meetings held by Qintex Australia Chairman Christopher Skase with bank creditors . Yesterday , Mr. Skase said the company is `` solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments . ''
value.n | 2 | `` We can lose money on this , '' he says . `` And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , '' says Mrs. Hammack , reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand . Earthquake insurance costs about $ 2 to $ 4 annually for every $ 1,000 of %% value %% , and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe . So , many Californians believe they can get by without it . Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption .
value.n | 1 | Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital . `` Before futures , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic %% value %% . '' While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks . When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows .
value.n | 2 | The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the %% value %% and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument . Scott Miller , an FASB project manager , said that a final rule will be issued before year end . But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months .
value.n | 2 | SCI TV , which is controlled by Nashville , Tenn. , entrepreneur George Gillett , owns six TV stations , including several CBS Inc. affiliates . It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out . Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors %% value %% at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar . KKR would give up a 31 % equity stake to bondholders , while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8 % stake . While one big SCI TV investor thinks that 's pretty generous , many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV .
value.n | 2 | Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills . So why does Renaissance 's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28 , where it closed yesterday , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ? `` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better %% value %% all the time , '' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday . Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8 % from about 9 % at the start of the year . Stock prices , meanwhile , are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9 .
value.n | 2 | `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said . He did n't elaborate . But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's %% value %% . Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate , currently about 4 1\/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . '' In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years .
value.n | 3 | There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional . The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility . But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a snail , '' they say , `` important %% values %% such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . '' Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low . Honda has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey , and a slightly larger cousin , the Gorilla .
value.n | 3 | As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) . He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ? Primarily because there 's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan 's personal %% values %% , or lack of them . Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards . The theme song for the 1980s has been , `` Anything Goes , '' and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism .
value.n | 2 | The loss is a setback to IBM , which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration . That 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations . A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential %% value %% of the contract , which is still in negotiation . He said that American Telephone & Telegraph , MCI Communications Corp. , Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital 's subcontractors on the project . `` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said Paul Allen , the spokesman .
value.n | 2 | The computer maker said net jumped to $ 87 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 58 million , or $ 1.40 a share , a year earlier . Sales increased 36 % to $ 683 million from $ 502 million . The latest quarter 's results , however , included a pretax gain of $ 13.7 million , or 20 cents a share , in the carrying %% value %% of the company 's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $ 7.6 million gain , or 11 cents a share , from the sale of one million Conner shares . Net for the nine months was $ 254 million , or $ 5.94 a share , up 56 % from $ 163 million , or $ 4.06 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose 50 % to $ 2.1 billion from $ 1.4 billion .
value.n | 2 | And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc . Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional %% value %% . Mr. Pilson calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year . `` It 's too early to tell '' what happens after that , he says .
value.n | 2 | Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions . The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation , which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994 . Previously , Columbia did n't have to adjust the book %% value %% of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments . Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices . For its future strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities .
value.n | 2 | Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street . Traders said that Mr. Greenspan , whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets . Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee , Mr. Greenspan said the short-term %% value %% of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank . `` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. Greenspan said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy . In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5 % as `` much too high to be ignored . ''
value.n | 2 | The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned . Mr. Icahn has long believed , associates say , that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled $ 16.88 billion , is worth $ 70 a share if broken up . The stock closed yesterday at $ 33.625 , giving Mr. Icahn 's 33.6 million shares a %% value %% of $ 1.13 billion . Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say .
value.n | 3 | Ms. Bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` South Pacific , '' is decidedly downtown . Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters , still hosting an annual `` A Christmas Carol . '' How would this bastion of traditional %% values %% fare in Ms. Bogart 's iconoclastic hands ? She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season . It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht 's theoretical writings , called `` No Plays , No Poetry . ''
value.n | 2 | Many agencies roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans . In any case , they avoid having to write off the loans . Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books ; as late as 1987 , the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face %% value %% loans made to Cuba in the 1950s . More seriously , FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value . Until GAO 's recent audit , FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years .
value.n | 2 | Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators . Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds . But should they spy one , the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its %% value %% . For these workers at the bottom of the mine 's pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail . Still , employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two .
value.n | 2 | The buy-back , coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares , would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26 % . The Norfolk , Va. , company has 172.2 million shares outstanding . In a statement , Arnold B. McKinnon , chairman and chief executive officer , noted that the new repurchase program `` should serve to enhance shareholder %% value %% . '' A spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand , borrowing and `` cash Norfolk expects to generate . '' Analysts said they expected the action , and investors applauded the move .
value.n | 2 | But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face %% value %% . The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
value.n | 2 | Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market %% value %% '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
value.n | 2 | That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators . These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987 . In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual %% value %% of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) . World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998 . The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 .
value.n | 2 | Rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company , but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened . `` The board has stated repeatedly that Rubbermaid should be independent , '' said Walter W. Williams , Rubbermaid president . Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments , but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25 % or more of Rubbermaid 's voting securities , each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid shares with a market %% value %% of twice the right 's exercise price . Mr. Williams said the exercise price is $ 125 , meaning holders would have the right to buy $ 250 of Rubbermaid stock for half price , diluting the investor 's 25 % stake . For the third quarter , Rubbermaid earned $ 32.6 million , or 44 cents a share , up 16 % from $ 28.1 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
value.n | 2 | Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . '' And much home-equity credit is used conservatively . `` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the %% value %% of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says . So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 ) . A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .

value.n | 2 | A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund . Also holding two seats each on the board , they said , would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada , and Itel Corp. , controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell . The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the %% value %% of their investments , including possible spinoffs . Itel bought a 17 % stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20 % stake ; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific . The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
value.n | 2 | The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan . And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it . The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder %% value %% , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . '' But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy . The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
value.n | 2 | But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential %% values %% for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection .
value.n | 2 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any effect on us . We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the %% value %% of our existing bonds . '' The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 . Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa .

value.n | 1 | For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence %% value %% with traditional random patrols . Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .

The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market %% value %% of 101 . However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset can only be 15.5 % . Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock of CNW Holdings .
value.n | 2 | Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market %% value %% from the 40 % currently allowed . Falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions . A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end .
value.n | 2 | So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive . Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face %% value %% to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .

'' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist %% values %% , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .

He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
value.n | 2 | Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan . As part of the agreement , Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $ 25 million to the assets of Independent American . While under the control of federal regulators , Independent American 's net worth dropped from $ 75 million to a negative $ 400 million , wiping out the %% value %% of Mr. Gaubert 's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution . Mr. Gaubert 's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act , which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees . Earlier this week , a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney 's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert 's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert 's claim for the loss of his property .
value.n | 2 | Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $ 75 million stock-for-debt exchange . The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal . As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face %% value %% of debt . However , that figure could be revised , Financial Corp. said . Currently , the company has about six million common shares outstanding .

And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business . Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market %% value %% of the company . There was just one sticking point : The two had a prior commitment . Just seven months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit `` Batman . ''

The ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position . Some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in %% value %% as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions . Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest . Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market %% value %% of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years . If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years , McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it , and the independent directors will run the bidding . The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .

Few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most California property values . But real-estate experts and brokers said the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built on less stable ground , especially in the Bay Area .
value.n | 2 | Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , Calif . Sterling , which estimated the %% value %% of the contract at $ 150 million , said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations . In 1988 , Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract , claiming it had submitted the lowest bid . As a result , last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract .
value.n | 2 | The debentures were issued in the face amount of $ 46 million on July 11 , 1988 , the Ashland , Ky. , coal mining , water transportation and construction company said . The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington 's stock has equaled or exceeded $ 19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days , a condition set in the terms of the debentures . Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the %% value %% of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $ 1,103.11 redemption price .
value.n | 2 | Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries . Tosco Corp. jumped $ 1.125 to $ 20.125 and Chevron Corp. , despite a temporary pipeline shutdown , rose $ 1 to $ 65 . Meanwhile , shares of some big housing lenders got hit , on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral -- people 's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in %% value %% . Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $ 81.50 , and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $ 31.875 . Some California thrift stocks also fell , including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , which reported lower earnings yesterday .
value.n | 2 | That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6 % in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1 % in 1986 and 8 % in 1987 . Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin . In theory , the %% value %% attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same . But of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits . This is indeed what the market decided .
value.n | 2 | According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden , N.J . In February 1987 , Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for $ 83.7 million -- more than $ 18 million above market price . The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market %% value %% to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer . Lawyers for shareholders , Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed . But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump , with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .

Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or `` strike price , '' of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar . The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life .
value.n | 2 | The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value . Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the %% value %% of the nation 's capital stock ? The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion . The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .
value.n | 2 | We 're talking real money . When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed . Instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7 % off the %% value %% of the nation 's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world . Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea . Why is this happening ?

value.n | 1 | After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985 , Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension . But now , the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk . `` The name Classic Coke has tremendous %% value %% , and they have n't merchandised that name before , '' says Jesse Meyers , publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest . The Coke spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand . Indeed , analysts have said that the absence of new products , among other factors , has limited sales growth throughout the industry .
value.n | 2 | Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance . Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces . Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won 's %% value %% remains heavily controlled . Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved `` satisfactorily '' but gave no hint when that will happen . Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier , he said South Korea ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues `` without causing political and social trauma .
value.n | 2 | A classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance , now widely discredited . Before the 1987 crash , an estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique . The idea was to `` insure '' the %% value %% of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves . But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets .
value.n | 2 | Sales were $ 623 million , up 0.5 % from $ 619.8 million a year ago . Rohm & Haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense . The company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the %% value %% of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars . In addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter . Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
value.n | 2 | The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives , a business that accounts for some 10 % of IBM 's $ 60 billion of annual revenue . IBM , which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term . In addition , IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the %% value %% of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars . Earnings fell to $ 877 million , or $ 1.51 a share , somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ 1.60 a share . That compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion , or $ 2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute .

value.n | 2 | However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . `` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation %% values %% , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain . `` Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies . '' Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau .
value.n | 2 | In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters . The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens . The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book %% value %% of the collection { be } reduced to zero . '' In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . ''
work.v | 2 | The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves . In recent months , researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes %% work %% in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .

Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it %% work %% , '' says one investment banker who follows the retail industry . `` Looking only at a narrow American strategy is n't where it 's at .

Anne Burford , the former EPA chief who resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with Congress , was kayoed in the confrontation , even though she was never charged with official wrondgoing . She %% worked %% part-time as a consultant and wrote a book , but never restarted her high-powered legal career .

work.v | 1 | State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them . Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed . The Communists spent 40 years %% working %% to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here . Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started . But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already : the private farmer .

He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him ; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return . So he asked the IRS if the plan would %% work %% . Well , notes IRS private ruling 8934014 , `` a fundamental principle '' is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it . The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says .
work.v | 1 | The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs %% works %% for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image .

Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't %% work %% : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea . Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children . Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
work.v | 2 | Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will %% work %% important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently .
work.v | 2 | In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish . By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries . The ploy %% worked %% . The defense won . In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame .
work.v | 2 | But they think promotions are limited . THE HOUSE votes down a proposal to put pension plans under the control of joint labor-management boards . Some consultants had insisted it would n't %% work %% . LONG-TERM care insurance gains favor . More than half the people surveyed for the Employee Benefit Research Institute say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage .
work.v | 1 | `` The RTC needs the most able , competent management available . '' But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking . He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also %% worked %% for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election . The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director . In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp .
work.v | 1 | Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once %% worked %% on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says . In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous .
work.v | 1 | `` That 's always looking back , '' she said . `` I wanted to be in business . '' On the way to that goal , she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to %% work %% for a fund-raising organization . Soon she was running the office . When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist .
work.v | 8 | More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending . The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries . Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it %% works %% out a plan for paying its debts . American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .
work.v | 1 | Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident . He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III . Aside from %% working %% with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson . The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy 's top spot by Mr. Sorrell . But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine ( The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client ) .
work.v | 1 | Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood . Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer . Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be %% working %% as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera . After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . '' But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
work.v | 1 | The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged . Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt . That was his reward for %% working %% until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent . For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service . For creating a focus for neighborhood life .
work.v | 2 | And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline . There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC . `` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything %% works %% for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director . Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar . These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
work.v | 1 | Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc . In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now %% works %% with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest . It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country . The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba .
work.v | 8 | Mary Poulin Palo Alto , Calif. I suggest that The Wall Street Journal ( as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind ) should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists . Perhaps an arrangement could be %% worked %% out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories . Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support . Douglas B. Evans
work.v | 1 | `` The small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , '' says Mr. Purnick , 75 years old . `` We make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around . '' Mr. Rosen , though , believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has %% worked %% for most of his 57 years . `` You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively , '' he says . Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years .
work.v | 2 | But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it %% work %% , '' says Mr. Anderson . What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
work.v | 2 | A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to %% work %% with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work . The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
work.v | 1 | The market 's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash . It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds . Brady and Breeden %% work %% well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post . BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics . Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation .
work.v | 1 | `` What they want us to do just is n't practical , '' he says , noting that he employs 16 blacks . `` I could n't afford to hire 16 whites . The only Afrikaners who would be willing to %% work %% for this salary would n't know how to handle money . '' Back at the Verwoerd house , Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr . The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics , Morgenzon will boom .
work.v | 1 | The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll . Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA . Although %% working %% for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively . During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .
work.v | 2 | It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) . But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet . In other words , nationalism %% worked %% well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; ; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis . Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty . The former receives its legitimacy from the latter .
work.v | 8 | As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength . No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction . Until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are %% worked %% out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions . America possesses an enormous defense power . It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .
work.v | 8 | An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance . Thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level . Thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change %% works %% itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man . Further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change . With regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ?
work.v | 1 | In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some %% working %% for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .
work.v | 1 | Madison once remarked : `` My life has been so much a public one '' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six . Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests . Washington never had a chance to %% work %% for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management . He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation . John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah Gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it '' .
work.v | 9 | The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious orgy . A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon . It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually %% worked %% up to high , shrill appeals to God and man . And then the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and then here in Alabama . With shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering , wailing , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force .
work.v | 1 | `` This coat looks like a rag heap '' . There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder . Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to %% work %% . He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes . `` Hey '' ! ! Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes .
work.v | 1 | Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below . Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity . Mrs. Balcolm %% worked %% for the brain . Mrs . Ten Eyke did mental health . Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .
work.v | 1 | He sighed . How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him %% work %% and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed . His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days . His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .
work.v | 1 | Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day . He tended the new colts Beau had sired . He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees %% working %% against the summer 's purple dusk . No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph . They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .
work.v | 1 | The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he complained , not liking to %% work %% on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean . Scrub the studio once a week .
work.v | 8 | Balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations . Therefore to Helva , the problem that she could n't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . She would %% work %% out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing . She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental . Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .
work.v | 2 | Out of that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations ; ; suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water supplies . Besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be thrashed out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history . The trouble with them was that they almost never %% worked %% , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled . Suppose that this one were to work ? ? There was no question in Jack 's mind of the good faith on one side , at least .
work.v | 1 | You get ready '' He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air . Gavin 's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , %% working %% by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words . When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch . The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .
work.v | 1 | I guess you 'd better go on in the morning '' . `` We 'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly . `` I 've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to %% work %% on a ranch . Sharon , she 's cooked in a restaurant . We 'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' .
work.v | 8 | To his surprise his plan worked perfectly . `` All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling . `` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and %% work %% your problems '' . And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . He scarcely saw them .
work.v | 1 | If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ; those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick . I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans ' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter . The arrangement I had with him was to %% work %% four hours a day . The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting . I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .
work.v | 1 | It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man . ( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hands %% worked %% for $ 30 and found ) . Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark . ( A detailed search of old coroner 's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest ) .
work.v | 1 | The one thing they had in common was their hatred . Both hated Donald Kruger . It had drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had %% worked %% tirelessly to effect this night 's escape . He said now , `` I 've got the perfect headquarters set up . The old Haskell mine '' .
work.v | 4 | She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . `` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . He saw her hand start to %% work %% down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . `` I 've had enough of that .
work.v | 8 | General Hershey 's draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence , but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time . Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one . Mr. Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in %% working %% out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position . Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas . Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard Freddy 's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns .
work.v | 4 | The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands . The snake %% worked %% away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods . The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target . I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .
work.v | 1 | I 'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still did n't want to leave him for five whole days . But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group . I had n't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to %% work %% harder than ever . I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group . So I went to Boston .
work.v | 1 | And then there was Linda 's engagement to Bobbie Evans . There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie was n't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who %% worked %% for the same steel company as John did . Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . It was n't even John and Edythe .
work.v | 1 | `` I will . You , also . Do n't %% work %% too hard '' . It was an automatic phrase ; ; as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it . He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
work.v | 1 | The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to %% work %% . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . In a way , Askington was right .
work.v | 1 | When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him . I asked her if she would , and she said she would not . He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and %% work %% with them that she did not intend to marry him . Anyway , I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself . She came to me one day .
work.v | 1 | Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or Abe Spector , a process-server , we could n't determine which . His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott 's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . The grocery the youth %% worked %% for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .
work.v | 1 | How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ? Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to %% work %% on . After that everything should be simpler . He went upstairs to phone Crumb .
work.v | 9 | Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . It almost always %% works %% out for the best . ) Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I can not say . With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse .
