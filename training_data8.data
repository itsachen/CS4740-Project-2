affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
affect.v | 1 | This is in response to George Melloan 's Business World column `` The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think '' ( op-ed page , Sept. 26 ) . In Houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become . Unused houses deteriorate rapidly , %% affecting %% the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim . At this stage some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value . But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so .

Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy . American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't %% affect %% their relationships with the ad agency . `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients .
affect.v | 1 | USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely %% affect %% the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines . Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel . One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
affect.v | 1 | Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to %% affect %% our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
affect.v | 1 | Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; ; but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type . Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ; and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare . Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes %% affecting %% Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature . The book concerned with the Negro 's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ; recently only Keith Wheeler 's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem . All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .

I really want to see that happen again . '' If this were 1949 , Mr. Boren might even succeed .
allow.v | 1 | The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings , mostly with Senate Democrats , to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut . The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax . According to some who attended , the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for %% allowing %% the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending . The president was said to have been noncommittal .
allow.v | 1 | The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . But it would %% allow %% considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .
allow.v | 1 | Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands . Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy . American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- %% allow %% this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share . The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way . The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
allow.v | 1 | Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' %% allowing %% extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors . `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says .
allow.v | 1 | No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly . But it 's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett did n't manage to boost SCI TV 's operating profit after the buy-out . Mr. Kravis apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again , %% allowing %% SCI TV to sell assets to pay debt . Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a Detroit station . As for junk-holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR .

'' DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would %% allow %% it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
allow.v | 1 | President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , %% allowing %% him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
allow.v | 1 | It also adds to the mystery of the venture . Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . `` Once people got into it , I was %% allowing %% them to live a dream , '' he says . He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says . `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . ''
allow.v | 1 | The agency did n't mention possible quantities and did n't say how the gas would be delivered . A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong . Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to %% allow %% downtown redevelopment . But Beijing wants to use the base for the People 's Liberation Army after 1997 , when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty . Ke Zaishuo , head of China 's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong , accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said , `` This is something we can not accept . ''
allow.v | 1 | I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , %% allow %% psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now .

Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been . Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have %% allowed %% the dear baby to turn into triplets . There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss Jen , hon .

announce.v | 1 | Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a Washington priority . `` The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada 's membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , '' said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. . The Canadian application is expected to be %% announced %% in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . `` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada 's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization .

Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may %% announce %% `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season . `` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen . `` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
announce.v | 1 | If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was %% announced %% at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell .

Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . Goodson also %% announced %% that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .

announce.v | 1 | The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome . On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses . The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by %% announcing %% : `` Today I go see the horses '' . It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .
announce.v | 2 | He had lots of friends , then as always . Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend .

And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to %% announce %% to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .

approve.v | 1 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also %% approved %% was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .

approve.v | 1 | The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . '' Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . Use of dispersants was %% approved %% when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said .
approve.v | 1 | On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange . At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor ( $ 386 million ) to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say . The board had also been expected to %% approve %% a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 ( $ 4.48 ) to SKr205 ( $ 31.65 ) in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .

'' Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities . That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban %% areas %% . Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says Maurice Geiger , founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier , Vt. , a public interest group that researches rural justice issues .
area.n | 1 | The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $ 3.6 million over six years , as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years , based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures , '' the Times said . The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter . The settlement , which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York %% area %% , will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system . Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times 's 1.1 million daily circulation . Currently , about 60 % of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times .
area.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade %% areas %% , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
area.n | 2 | It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number . Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off . Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital %% areas %% such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado . Analysts also say it 's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $ 115 billion foreign debt , on which it suspended interest payments last month . Analysts say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food items .
area.n | 1 | Stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds . One was that , despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News , he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due . The other is that he 's an Oakland native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit %% areas %% last week . Afterward , as the A 's toasted their victory with beer ( they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims ) , Stewart said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy . `` Give me four or five more Series with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a Cy Young , '' he said , in reference to baseball 's best-pitcher award .

area.n | 1 | Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports . The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s , however , forcing the bank to face competition . At the same time , many of Spain 's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing %% areas %% faced a sharp decline in economic growth . As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .

area.n | 2 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all %% areas %% saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .

'' Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million , $ 200,000 annual income , or recent experience in the business %% area %% of the franchise being sold . But critics consider the changes regressive . Lewis G.

San Francisco Bay %% area %% officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
area.n | 1 | Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space . It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area . Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay %% area %% , including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area . The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments . The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year .
area.n | 2 | He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers . `` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says . `` They are n't prepared to compete in an %% area %% where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
area.n | 1 | A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts %% area %% are doing almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
area.n | 1 | These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city %% areas %% may represent a major new untapped market for investment . New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .

Insurance stocks continued to climb on expectations that premium rates will rise in the aftermath of the earthquake in the San Francisco %% area %% . American International Group climbed 4 to 106 5\/8 , General Re rose 3 1\/8 to 89 5\/8 , Kemper added 2 1\/2 to 48 , AON went up 1 3\/8 to 36 and Chubb rose 1 1\/4 to 82 1\/4 .

area.n | 1 | What if it happened to us ? In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo , many companies in disaster-prone %% areas %% are pondering the question of preparedness . Some , particularly in West Coast earthquake zones , are dusting off their evacuation plans , checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes . Others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster .
area.n | 1 | But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much . Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria %% area %% and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December . For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
area.n | 2 | Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines . Medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases . Car prices , another %% area %% that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month , still showed declines at the consumer level . They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers . Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row , far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year .
area.n | 1 | Officials say it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow . The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem . Moreover , state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the %% area %% 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours . Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . ''
area.n | 1 | A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big , untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta %% area %% of the western Canadian Arctic . Three companies , Esso Resources Canada Ltd. , Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. , applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996 . To be economically feasible , the 11 billion Canadian dollar ( US$ 9.37 billion ) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices .
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
area.n | 1 | Business in the nation 's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home . The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually all businesses shut down . The $ 125-billion-a-year Bay %% area %% economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation 's most populous state and accounts for 2 % to 3 % of the nation 's total output of goods and services , according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto . In high-tech , the Bay area accounts for 15 % to 20 % of the U.S. computer-related industry . `` This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy , '' says Pauline Sweezey , the chief economist at the California Department of Finance .
area.n | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications ' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area to alleviate congestion . The companies block traffic much as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up . William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay %% area %% , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product .
area.n | 1 | Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area . About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks . Some adjusters , already in other parts of California , drove to the disaster %% area %% with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers . Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims . State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .
area.n | 1 | And if I think that some people { on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 's } staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown , I have to tell you something -- I 'm not going to take it . I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here . And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our %% area %% . And if we 're not ombudsman for our area , we ought to be thrown out of office . On the other hand , if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story .
area.n | 1 | `` It 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way , '' said Sally Stewart , a spokeswoman for the Red Cross . `` It just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget . '' The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay %% area %% , serving 5,000 people . Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states . All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA , agency officials said .
area.n | 2 | But many investors remain wary about stocks , partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers . `` I 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility '' in stocks , said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker . `` I think the problems in the junk-bond %% area %% are just beginning , and this will be very unsettling for companies that have issued junk bonds . In a bull market , credit does not matter , '' Mr. DeVoe added . `` But when it does matter , then it 's the only thing that matters . ''
area.n | 1 | `` We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down . '' Amtrak said it suspended train service into its Oakland station , which sustained `` heavy structural damage '' during the quake . The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in Sacramento , relying on buses to ferry passengers to the Bay %% area %% . Amtrak said it planned to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday . Rail-transit operations suffered little damage , according to Albert Engelken , deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington .
area.n | 1 | Intel also added 3\/8 to 33 7\/8 . But Sun Microsystems slipped 1\/4 to 17 1\/4 . Shares of biotechnology companies in the %% area %% were also higher . Chiron was up 1\/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1\/2 to 16 3\/8 . The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved , too .
area.n | 1 | CALIFORNIA STRUGGLED with the aftermath of a Bay %% area %% earthquake . As aftershocks shook the San Francisco Bay area , rescuers searched through rubble for survivors of Tuesday 's temblor , and residents picked their way through glass-strewn streets . In Oakland , hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway .
area.n | 1 | The calls reached many , but certainly not all , of the publicly held companies with operations in the area . In most cases damage to company facilities and operations was minimal . ADIA SERVICES INC. , Menlo Park , temporary personnel agency , annual sales of $ 504 million , OTC , said all 30 offices in Bay %% area %% were working , but in various states of disarray . Business was slow because many companies were closed yesterday . ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC. , Sunnyvale , integrated circuit maker , annual sales of $ 1.12 billion , NYSE , had only minor structural damage .
area.n | 1 | It also was n't known what the impact will be on the division 's work , which includes the Navy 's Trident submarine-based missile program and the Air Force 's Strategic Defense Initiative . The division had only minor damage at its Sunnyvale headquarters and plant in Palo Altos , and no delays in deliveries are expected . LONGS DRUG STORES INC. , Walnut Creek , drugstore chain , annual sales of $ 1.9 billion , NYSE , had only minor damage and only four of its 75 Bay-area stores , all in the Santa Cruz %% area %% , were closed .

area.n | 2 | The comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain %% areas %% of wholesale banking . Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said .
area.n | 3 | Despite the number of fans that office massage has won , some purists look down on it , arguing that naked , full-body rubs are the only way to go . Linda Aldridge , who does full-body work in Pittsburgh , says that while on-site massage is better than nothing , tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg . `` Whole %% areas %% of their bodies are neglected , '' she says , adding that clothes ruin the experience . `` There 's nothing like skin to skin .

ask.v | 1 | `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really %% asking %% is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says . Then , he answers his own question . `` Yes , they are .
ask.v | 2 | Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down . `` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said Steve Burzon , publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home . And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , said advertisers are frequently %% asked %% to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , president of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
ask.v | 1 | State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed ( Drexel ) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and %% asked %% for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''

The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .
ask.v | 2 | Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . Washington rejected the bid , saying the hostages were n't linked to other issues . PLO leader Arafat %% asked %% Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula . Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from drugs to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . ''
ask.v | 2 | All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . '' Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . '' Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm %% asking %% people to broaden their agendas .

He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale .
ask.v | 2 | President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . Mr. Bush %% asked %% Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
ask.v | 3 | The previous sale was $ 436,000 on Oct. 17 ; the last time prices were that low was November 1985 , when a seat sold for $ 425,000 . Prices peaked at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 . Seats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 %% asked %% .
ask.v | 1 | Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . He talked about 20 minutes . When he was through , the court members %% asked %% many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
ask.v | 2 | Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people ? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey %% asked %% for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans . Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey is n't really part of Europe .
ask.v | 2 | Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg . He `` legitimized '' Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles . Victor Berger , the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress , had %% asked %% Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English . Carl , who was stationed in Appleton , Wisconsin , organizing for the Social Democrats , was in Berger 's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar . She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton , Illinois .
ask.v | 1 | The story ends in the child 's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother . The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside . I had read the story many times without %% asking %% myself why it affected me or caring why it did . But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story . It was , of course , a little boy 's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .
ask.v | 1 | I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . And why not ? ? How , I %% asked %% , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ? If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .
ask.v | 2 | You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' . Others mentioned that I might have had to %% ask %% friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears . Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
ask.v | 1 | She said , `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is '' ? ? `` No '' , said Wilson , `` I do n't . I was just %% asking %% about it . What is it '' ? ? `` It 's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates .
ask.v | 2 | His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son .

ask.v | 2 | She concluded by %% asking %% him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . The fish took the bait . He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .
ask.v | 2 | At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to %% ask %% Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
ask.v | 1 | I wish our doctor could have saved her '' . `` It was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton . `` Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg '' ? ? She %% asked %% him , seeing Juanita 's eyes grow bleak . `` As you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly . He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .
ask.v | 1 | The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and %% asked %% if there was anything he could do for them . Harold shook his head . `` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .
ask.v | 1 | What now ? ? Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned . `` Plot '' ? ? John %% asked %% tiredly . `` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit . I went to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here .
ask.v | 1 | So what ? ? Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ? ( he %% asked %% this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) . Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him . He could n't make out what he was saying .
ask.v | 1 | He remembered them well from his happy period . Formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them . He tried to %% ask %% the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again . She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body . She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech .
ask.v | 1 | `` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ? Tanner wisecracked . `` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners . `` Are you my partner '' ? ? She %% asked %% hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform . `` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully . `` No one has come .
ask.v | 2 | What Gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws . The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man 's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature . The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was %% asking %% him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust . Nothing less would serve . And it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war .
ask.v | 1 | When they had licked the last of the wieners ' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette . Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad . `` How come you 're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ? Ernie %% asked %% . Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply . But surprisingly , Kitty 's face came up and she said , `` My father .
ask.v | 1 | `` The kid has no manners , boys . Shall we teach him some '' ? ? His gun was half drawn when he %% asked %% the question , but the weapon never left its holster . Tilghman 's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin . His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .
ask.v | 6 | He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps . The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America . `` Join me in another '' ? ? He had %% asked %% . `` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously . `` I do not drink so much '' .
ask.v | 1 | They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds . They finished the small bottle of Steinhager . She confessed she was unhappy , he %% asked %% was it her husband ? ? She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please do n't judge all poets '' .
ask.v | 2 | `` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin ' coward face-to-face '' ! ! He exploded . `` That 's all I %% ask %% '' ! ! He never got that chance . For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .
ask.v | 2 | Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she %% asked %% for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
ask.v | 1 | His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She %% asked %% him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
ask.v | 1 | She was even more miserable than me . Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them . `` Now is n't it better to smile '' ? ? She %% asked %% . Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ? I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
ask.v | 2 | I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , would n't it ? ? What she 'd said was true -- in all these years , she 'd never %% asked %% for anything from me . If I let her go , she 'd disappear once more . And Gladdy would be safe ! !
ask.v | 1 | Abruptly he reached into his pocket . Yes , there was the key . `` Are you positive you 'll be all right by yourself '' ? ? She %% asked %% him . For a moment he smiled . `` Yes , Julie dear .
ask.v | 1 | A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . `` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll %% ask %% the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . There 's so little to do '' .
ask.v | 2 | The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps . He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish . Rachel said , `` He %% asks %% for money '' . She passed by him . I reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin .
ask.v | 1 | Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town . Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine . Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , %% asked %% quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on . `` See for yourself , Miss Zion . It will n't take a minute '' .
ask.v | 1 | `` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . `` This is a warm-up '' . `` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ? %% Asked %% one of the children . `` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped . One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions .
ask.v | 1 | It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was %% asked %% whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ?
attempt.v | 1 | For one thing , Pentagon officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time persuading Europeans to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out . At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe . Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever %% attempted %% . So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? ''
attempt.v | 1 | In addition , it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off . Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection ( taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies ) and to deny new credit to defaulters . These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that %% attempt %% to offset market imperfections . 3 . Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget . Since the budget measures cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan is treated as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be paid back .
attempt.v | 1 | Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been %% attempting %% to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
attempt.v | 1 | The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had %% attempted %% to make it a successorship by inheritance . It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation .
attempt.v | 1 | `` Nate '' ! ! He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him . `` I ai n't going to fight you no more '' . Nate turned his head , %% attempting %% to speak in a soothing voice . `` I know you ai n't '' ! ! Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall . He moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate 's head and clamped it on his own .
authority.n | 3 | Here are two cases to illustrate . Assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car . The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the %% authorities %% carry them away . Assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack . There is no way to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital .
authority.n | 3 | In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow { it } to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . '' The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks . First Union , with assets of about $ 32 billion , said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory %% authorities %% . The bank added that it believes the review will `` demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act . '' The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger .
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
authority.n | 3 | But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies . Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left . New York %% authorities %% , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it . `` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said Stanley Grayson , New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development . Meanwhile , Dallas welcomed the move .
authority.n | 3 | Revenue doubled from two years ago . That is , if the company reported results correctly . The Asahi Shimbun , a Japanese daily , last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax %% authorities %% over a two-year period . The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment , and Mr. Kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . The small , wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world .
authority.n | 3 | One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20 % of his time on insurance , he says . Other forms of red tape are more pervasive . The most onerous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record-keeping and filing required by tax %% authorities %% . Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second . But gripes run the gamut .
authority.n | 3 | The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out . Dozens of workers were injured , %% authorities %% said . There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
authority.n | 1 | The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee . Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies . However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit %% authority %% to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans . The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans .
authority.n | 3 | This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . In making cases , the %% authorities %% frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
authority.n | 1 | But Mr. Skinner disagreed , calling the legislation `` a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry . '' In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson ( D. , Calif. ) , the secretary also said the bill `` would be at odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources . '' Currently , the Transportation Department does n't have the %% authority %% to block a takeover in advance . However , if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate , the department may revoke its certificate , grounding the airline . Such authority is more than adequate , say opponents of the legislation .
authority.n | 1 | It 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs . For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it . Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois ( the first time that a state has used its educational facilities %% authority %% to support construction of a theater ) , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets . The rest , he is confident , can be raised . His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
authority.n | 5 | Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency . That is n't all . Last year , the Irish airport %% authority %% , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport . Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow . Duty-free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July , and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon .
avoid.v | 1 | `` The World Series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester , which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago . `` You 've got to judge where the network will be in three years . '' The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if CBS ca n't %% avoid %% big losses on the sports coverage itself . And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc .
avoid.v | 1 | Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . But for the most part , officials have %% avoided %% expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
avoid.v | 1 | The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants . The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors %% avoid %% disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said . Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said . The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
avoid.v | 1 | He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` The situation you want to %% avoid %% is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says . `` That 's crazy . '' His advice : Do n't panic .
avoid.v | 1 | This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby %% avoid %% the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .
avoid.v | 1 | The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson 's boots . At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to %% avoid %% striking his head on the heavy beams . In the corner was the soldier with the white flag . He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth .
avoid.v | 1 | She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . When there was bridge at Edythe 's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who 'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to %% avoid %% a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
base.n | 1 | Also , a contract with the United Auto Workers at the company 's helicopter plant in Philadelphia expired Oct. 15 . This contract , covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day-to-day basis . The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10 % %% base %% wage increase over the life of the three-year contract , plus bonuses of 8 % the first year and 3 % the second . On top of that , Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5 % for each year of the contract . The union , though , has called the offer `` insulting . ''
base.n | 7 | Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people . Congress sent to Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % . The measure also moves more than $ 450 million in the Pentagon budget to home-state projects from foreign %% bases %% . U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases . The talks in New York are the first since Bush and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze unveiled proposals in September to scrap existing weapons .
base.n | 7 | Congress sent to President Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % while revamping the Pentagon budget to move more than $ 450 million from foreign %% bases %% to home-state projects . The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees , and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S. 's standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable . Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany , Japan , South Korea , the United Kingdom and the Philippines , for example , are cut by almost two-thirds , while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home .
base.n | 3 | It has more drug users than Boston has people . Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all . Its tax %% base %% is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year . This is New York City . When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
base.n | 3 | The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist . `` If you have a position , you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much , '' says Republican strategist John Sears . The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush , who , Mr. Sears maintains , lacks a strong ideological %% base %% . By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters , the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments . Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House .
base.n | 3 | Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies . By and large , these efforts have borne fruit . In my home region , Latin America , much of the existing infrastructure %% base %% -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank . Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank 's adjustment lending . What are the facts on this type of lending ?
base.n | 7 | In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet %% bases %% may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas . Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .
base.n | 1 | Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day . `` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president . The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a %% base %% cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service . One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm . `` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. Amram says .

base.n | 3 | AMR has not been , and is not , for sale . '' Mr. Crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather . `` Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital %% base %% , '' he said .
base.n | 7 | In autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates . At the last minute , however , Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar , perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces . The deal fell through , and Kandahar remains a major regime %% base %% . The resistance lacks not only air power , armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime .
begin.v | 2 | He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring . Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , %% began %% months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage . They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells . Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .

They pile out of their truck and furiously %% begin %% twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter , a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep . If they finish today , the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow . One roustabout , hanging by his hands from a ladder , bounces his weight on a three-foot wrench to loosen a stuck fitting .
begin.v | 1 | Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines . The disarray in the junk-bond market that %% began %% last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation 's largest law firms . While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary , many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has been so lucrative in the past . Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour .
begin.v | 2 | New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . '' The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE -- which involve the actual S&P stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets , and index options on the CBOE -- will %% begin %% trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings . The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading . ESPs are also an attempt by the Big Board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London .

In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems %% began %% in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line . In September 1988 , Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc. , a closely held New York chain operated under the Bonds name . Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .

'' Cemetery officials hope the ads , which will %% begin %% airing next month , will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions . Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery . The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots .
begin.v | 1 | Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume . September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the exchange %% began %% making such figures public in July 1988 . A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever . The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies .
begin.v | 2 | The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll . The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson . But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll %% began %% focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .

Rally 's Inc. , a Louisville , Ky. , restaurant franchisor , started trading under RLLY .
begin.v | 2 | The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips . Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year . An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already %% beginning %% to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said . The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
begin.v | 1 | The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it . The Direct Selling Association , a trade group , points out that its members , which include Amway Corp. , cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject . The independent-contractor project , which %% began %% in 1988 , involves about 350 IRS agents . In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors . The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms .

Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would %% begin %% producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .

That is n't the $ 40 that delighted producers a decade ago or the $ 10 that pleased users a year ago . But it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies , low enough to promote consumption and , most important , steady enough for both producers and users to %% believe %% in . Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again . The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's crude .

Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla . I %% believe %% Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others . A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management . Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .
believe.v | 1 | The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least . The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites . But John LaWare , a Fed governor , told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed 's %% believes %% the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating . For instance , he noted , the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites . Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination .

Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she %% believes %% Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said .

Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he %% believes %% will be temporarily better price behavior .

That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . It is to say rather , I %% believe %% , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern . The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .
believe.v | 1 | The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They %% believe %% that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .

We must %% believe %% we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
believe.v | 1 | This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . And yet we obviously also %% believe %% that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?

The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday 's auction to 7.79 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04 % .

However , the Treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date .

And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the %% bill %% would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe . Separately , the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .

But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . The Thurmond %% bill %% would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated . Among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage . The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death , including murder for hire .

Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 112 people . Congress sent to Bush an $ 8.5 billion military construction %% bill %% that cuts spending for new installations by 16 % . The measure also moves more than $ 450 million in the Pentagon budget to home-state projects from foreign bases . U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases .
bill.n | 3 | Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request . Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less , their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640 % and 430 % , respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures . The swift passage of the %% bill %% , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs . By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration . The House Democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions , but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere .
bill.n | 4 | The premium the elderly pay for coverage of doctor 's %% bills %% under Part B of the Medicare health insurance plan will rise to $ 29 a month in 1990 from $ 27.90 , the Department of Health and Human Services said . In addition , a second Part B premium to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $ 4.90 a month from $ 4 , if Congress does n't change the program . The House has voted to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 , however , which would end the monthly catastrophic-care premium , as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by about 40 % of the wealthier Medicare beneficiaries .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today , raising all new cash . The %% bills %% will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 , No non-competitive tenders will be accepted . Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | The next time you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit , consider what Congress did Friday . The Senate , 84-6 , voted to increase to $ 124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the FHA , which lost $ 4.2 billion in loan defaults last year . Then , by voice vote , the Senate voted a pork-barrel %% bill %% , approved Thursday by the House , for domestic military construction . Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves : For construction in West Virginia , Mr. Bush requested $ 4.5 million ; Congress gave Senator Byrd 's state $ 21.5 million .
bill.n | 3 | Big chunks of the government budget , like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare , would n't be affected . Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity . And it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending %% bills %% rather than in the official bills themselves . Still , proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important `` chilling effect '' on all manner of appropriations bills . Lawmakers , they say , would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later .
bill.n | 3 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching %% bill %% that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
bill.n | 3 | This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers . A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the %% bill %% , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
bill.n | 3 | Last week , the government took three bills to the National Assembly . The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system . Highlights of the %% bills %% , as currently framed , are : -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation 's six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas . The government will penalize offenders , but wo n't confiscate property . -- A tax of between 3 % and 6 % on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling .
bill.n | 4 | In fact , six of those companies received refunds , which totaled $ 120 million . The lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments . This is the fifth year Citizens for Tax Justice has released a study on corporate tax %% bills %% . Earlier reports , which revealed that as many as 73 companies were avoiding income tax legally , have been credited with helping galvanize efforts to overhaul the tax code . But even though companies are paying more taxes , many are still paying less than the statutory rate , the report said .
bill.n | 3 | The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year , `` This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1 , 1989 . '' This means Interior contacts can not be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed . If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional %% bill %% , Rep.

In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . Daniel Brigham
bill.n | 5 | The man who brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer , a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program , Mr. Whitford writes . Mr. Meyer 's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a $ 100 bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards . One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 %% bills %% that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's president .
bill.n | 3 | The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements . The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a U.S. airline , even a straight cash purchase . Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers , now says the %% bill %% would further disturb the jittery capital markets . Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett , who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district , says the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . '' It is ironic that at a time when America 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia , so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline , Aeroflot .
bill.n | 3 | The White House called on Congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction %% bill %% , but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea . Earlier this month , the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act . But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work .
bill.n | 3 | In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . ) Also last spring , Rep. Ron Dellums ( D. , Calif. ) , introduced a %% bill %% requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement . In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping . The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .
bill.n | 3 | Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . He says he has n't yet studied the Dellums %% bill %% , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . '' Still , Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial . A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone .
bill.n | 3 | `` Unless he changes , they lose , '' said a Democratic leadership aide . The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . By a lopsided 97-1 margin , the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the %% bill %% on a 303-107 roll call . The package is more than $ 1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week . But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations .
bill.n | 4 | If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale 's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20 , manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10 . But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until March , April or even May . Some in the market question whether Campeau will be in a position to pay %% bills %% at that time . `` Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations , '' says Kurt Barnard , publisher of Barnard 's Retail Marketing Report . `` The buyers who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs .
bill.n | 3 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying %% bill %% approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
bill.n | 3 | Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians . The Diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time . So most %% bills %% are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair .
bill.n | 4 | That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . There is an element of make-work involved . Consumers pay the %% bill %% for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car . If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .
bill.n | 5 | FOREIGN PRIME RATES : Canada 13.50 % ; Germany 9 % ; Japan 4.875 % ; Switzerland 8.50 % ; Britain 15 % . These rate indications are n't directly comparable ; lending practices vary widely by location . Results of the Monday , October 23 , 1989 , auction of short-term U.S. government %% bills %% , sold at a discount from face value in units of $ 10,000 to $ 1 million : 7.52 % , 13 weeks ; 7.50 % , 26 weeks .

bill.n | 5 | TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month %% bills %% at the regular weekly auction . Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
bill.n | 3 | The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said . Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible . An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the %% bill %% . '' Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . '' Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
bill.n | 4 | Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts . Lawyers will benefit . Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge %% bill %% . The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
bill.n | 3 | `` As I was driving home , I did not feel very good about myself . '' We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again . A good place to start the rehabilitation is a `` legislative line-item veto '' %% bill %% now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats . The Coats bill , which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors , is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills . Instead it 's a form of `` enhanced rescission , '' giving a President a chance to rescind , or strike , specific spending items that just go too far .
bill.n | 3 | But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the %% bill %% makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency . Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger . Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C. ) , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
bill.n | 3 | Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year . Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction %% bill %% that did n't contain a capital-gains provision . That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators . The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
bill.n | 5 | Short-term rates rose yesterday . The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week %% bills %% yesterday . The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 . Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
bill.n | 4 | But at the same time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed . `` It 's like squeezing a balloon , '' Dr. Bailit said . David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care %% bills %% by about 5 % , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs . Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said .
bill.n | 3 | The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the %% bill %% are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt . The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market . `` It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort , '' Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee , said during the panel 's deliberations .
bill.n | 4 | Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected . But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims . `` Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the %% bill %% to reconstruct San Francisco , '' said Charles Lieberman , chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp . He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities . A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor 's Corp. concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake .
bill.n | 3 | Another solution , said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount . Since they have a lower interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility . The House version of the %% bill %% would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five . The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible . The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .
bill.n | 3 | The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $ 1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI , which owned the hospital in Sullivan , Mo. , during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment . In a separate development , a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $ 44 billion agriculture bill . A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the %% bill %% , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides . The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 . The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border .
bill.n | 3 | That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations %% bills %% . ( Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . ) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
bill.n | 3 | The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the power to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the %% bill %% . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low . The drop , following a 6.2 % decline in August , indicates the industry is still being hurt by the Fed 's anti-inflation battle .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury plans to raise $ 1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ 14.1 billion in maturing %% bills %% . The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Jan. 25 , 1990 , and April 26 , 1990 , respectively . Tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | Among major domestic agencies , the Environmental Protection Agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ 829.9 million . An estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation , and within the Housing and Urban Development Department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families . To an unusual degree , the massive %% bill %% has become a vehicle for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states . While the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities . The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the House and Senate .
bill.n | 3 | But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . It was the first time in 20 years that such government %% bills %% were defeated . In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power .
bill.n | 3 | Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as socalled locals . `` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel . Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in %% bills %% to reauthorize CFTC operations . The House 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system . The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .

Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to %% build %% market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs . At a news conference this week , Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .

Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale 's chairman , Marvin Traub , and more than half are seeking additional information on the group , bankers say . What Mr. Traub is hoping to put together , investment bankers say , is a management-led group to %% buy %% the New York department-store group that he heads from Campeau 's Federated Department Stores subsidiary . Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by Campeau , which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction . Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including Bloomingdale 's .

This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically %% buying %% cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents .

Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .

For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to %% buy %% between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .

Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to %% buy %% used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale . Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .

Besides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may %% buy %% furs later , he adds . Other furriers have also benefited from leathers . Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
buy.v | 3 | The difference is magnified by time , too . At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate . Did I %% buy %% it ? Well , not yet . I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
buy.v | 1 | A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months . The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the %% buying %% and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity . The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade . Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years .
buy.v | 3 | A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . The theory relies on three assumptions : 1 ) Voters can `` %% buy %% '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) . 3 ) Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect , '' he said . `` It 's the total relationship that is important . '' The total relationship , as Mr. Lee sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits , the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and %% capital %% . '' Japan 's recent political turbulence , Mr. Lee said , may mean Japan will slow market adjustments . `` They 'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from America , hurting their farmers . ''
capital.n | 1 | He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . `` If working %% capital %% financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
capital.n | 1 | These results compare with net income of $ 1.8 million , or 44 cents a share , for the corresponding period last year . This quarter 's loss includes pretax charges of $ 4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company 's troubled British subsidiary , and $ 3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory , publishing advances and pre-publication costs . The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser , assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives , including debt refinancing , raising %% capital %% , recapitalization , a merger or sale of the company . The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin , a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group , as an adviser . Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year .
capital.n | 1 | The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September . However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise %% capital %% , NRM said . In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change . Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
capital.n | 1 | It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates . Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . The price of attracting %% capital %% -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit . To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise . This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit .
capital.n | 1 | Crossland Savings Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline . A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the %% capital %% requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the `` core capital '' criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance . Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .
capital.n | 1 | At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $ 6 billion , an amount never thought possible in India . `` When they talk mega-issues , they 're truly talking mega , '' says S.A. Dave , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India . `` The %% capital %% market is booming . '' But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market . One is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
capital.n | 1 | And Mario Gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' Like others , Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away from stocks -- as many have already done . And those who remain , he says `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of %% capital %% to companies . '' Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital .
capital.n | 1 | But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991 . To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created %% capital %% gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption .
capital.n | 1 | Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . The move significantly expanded Black & Decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load . The acquisition boosted Black & Decker 's ratio of debt to total %% capital %% to more than 80 % . Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1\/2 years . Earlier this year , Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors .
capital.n | 1 | Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce %% capital %% , entrepreneurs say . If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
capital.n | 1 | There is likely to be a natural division of labor , says Francois Heisbourg , director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union , and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East . The designation at July 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step . In part , this division is dictated by economics : West Germany is a net exporter of %% capital %% while the U.S. is n't . While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems , yesterday France announced a three-year , four billion French franc ( $ 650 million ) aid plan for Poland . Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some Western European leaders , especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , remain skeptical about European political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds .
capital.n | 1 | The fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes Wertheim Schroder analyst John Rohs . Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . `` We were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for %% capital %% spending and also to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . DLJ argues that TW could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . But investors noted that under the shelved offering , TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments .
capital.n | 1 | What that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess . '' Campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ 1.23 billion in debt due next spring . This includes a working %% capital %% facility for Allied Stores of $ 350 million that matures March 15 , 1990 , and an $ 800 million bridge loan due April 30 , 1990 . The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments . In recent months , numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , including Bonwit Teller , B. Altman & Co. , and Miller & Rhoads Inc .
capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .
capital.n | 1 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for %% capital %% defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
capital.n | 1 | Those implications include : -- Privatization . Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance . Market-based pollution control may consume some %% capital %% that would otherwise purchase state industries . But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . -- Least-cost solutions .
capital.n | 2 | He has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting . So the senators must brace themselves . Sen. Cranston , as he returned to the %% capital %% last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco , sighed to an aide : `` Well , back to Keatingland .

The issue will be sold through Morgan Stanley & Co .
capital.n | 1 | Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held . In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents . The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity %% capital %% . At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding .
capital.n | 2 | Mutinies wrack his armed forces ( really just an armed gang ) , which control less than half the country . Inflation is at record levels . Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the %% capital %% of Mogadishu . Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
capital.n | 1 | The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's %% capital %% spending program .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
capital.n | 1 | In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of %% capital %% gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . Many other tax benefits also were swept away . This year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code .
capital.n | 1 | The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 . `` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up %% capital %% . At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions .
capital.n | 1 | Lonrho PLC of Britain is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine in an operation that has been engineered with the Paribas financial group , Societe Commerciale 's main shareholder . The announcement came as Societe Commerciale , a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries , reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ( $ 51 million ) for the first six months of this year , partly because of provisions on future losses . The rescue operation will consist of a %% capital %% boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds . Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to transfer its 30 % shareholding in Societe Commerciale to a new company which will be jointly owned with Lonrho . This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale .
capital.n | 2 | Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's %% capital %% of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
capital.n | 1 | Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets , the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin . In theory , the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same . But of course the market could decide that the firm 's %% capital %% stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits . This is indeed what the market decided . By 1982 the ratio was 43.5 % , meaning that the market was valuing every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at 43 cents .
capital.n | 1 | Not only was August 's deficit far worse than July 's , but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month . Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign %% capital %% , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness .
capital.n | 1 | The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value . Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's %% capital %% stock ? The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion . The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .
capital.n | 1 | At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital . First , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility . Second , the World Bank 's recent $ 75 billion %% capital %% increase -- $ 14 billion from the U.S. -- has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions . Third , the IMF would like to meet Japan 's request for increased ownership ( currently 4.5 % ) . Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues , and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries .
capital.n | 1 | Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline . The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose . If conservatives do n't support an increase in the IMF 's %% capital %% , then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative . Mr. Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's rout . Fossett still had several million dollars in %% capital %% left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said . Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen Fossett , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . S. Waite Rawls III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett , almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders .

Meanwhile , surviving Texas banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who truly %% care %% about the state .

I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling . Oh he 'd not %% care %% about the Pedersen kid . He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain . That would make him mad enough if he was sober .

And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch %% cared %% .

True , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much %% care %% . She was standing with her back to the glass door . Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .

At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; ; neither did he %% care %% that Aunt Rose provided for him . He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .

carrier.n | 6 | `` The only people who are flying are those who have to , '' said Frank Moore , chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association . He added : `` How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he can not guarantee a return flight ? '' Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic %% carriers %% , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 . Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary . Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions .

The USS Lexington returned to dock in Pensacola , Fla. , following an accident Sunday in which the pilot of a training jet crashed into the ship , killing five sailors . The captain of the aircraft %% carrier %% , the oldest in the Navy , said the flier was making his first attempt to land on a carrier .

carrier.n | 6 | `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % . Delta has benefited more than other %% carriers %% from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub . Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter . Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
carrier.n | 6 | And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions . Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the %% carrier %% 's chief executive officer . `` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said . `` There is no difference of opinion between ( Chairman ) Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy .
carrier.n | 6 | There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal . Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other %% carriers %% -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
carrier.n | 4 | In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century . The air force is to take at least 250 more . Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect %% carriers %% from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale .
carrier.n | 6 | Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . The %% carrier %% has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
carrier.n | 8 | Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit . Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % , noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit . Revenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance %% carrier %% business and diversified division . Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to $ 618.9 million from $ 599.4 million a year ago . New telephone lines posted healthy growth .
carrier.n | 6 | But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs . Under the committee bill , the Transportation secretary would have 30 days , and an additional 20 days if needed , to review any proposed purchase of 15 % or more of a major U.S. airline 's voting stock . The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the %% carrier %% 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt .
carrier.n | 6 | If USAir stepped up its share purchases , that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out , says Timothy Pettee , a Merrill Lynch analyst . But USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt , he adds . In 1987 , USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the %% carrier %% . Mr. Icahn , a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt , eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear , Stearns . Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route .
carrier.n | 6 | StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas . StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada . The %% carrier %% has n't yet turned a profit .
carrier.n | 6 | Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 . Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern . He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the %% carrier %% 's old volume of 1,050 a day .
carrier.n | 8 | One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive , a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co . Formed in August , the venture weds AT&T 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express 's Omaha , Neb. , service center . Other long-distance %% carriers %% have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool . Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television . The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years .
cause.v | 1 | Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes . But the ice-core samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. Thompson acknowledged . According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely %% caused %% by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space . Skeptics say that if that 's the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide . Instead , the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s , decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s , then higher temperatures again through last year .
cause.v | 1 | In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices . The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could %% cause %% a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
cause.v | 1 | Litigation consulting is , as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . '' He adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally . But the effort is also being made to try and %% cause %% jurors not to decide things rationally . I find it troubling . '' But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .
cause.v | 1 | The five astronauts returned to Earth about three hours early because high winds had been predicted at the landing site . Fog shrouded the base before touchdown . Explosions shook a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near Pasadena , Texas , hurling debris and %% causing %% a fire visible from 10 miles away . More than 100 people were injured , and a number of workers were missing . Parts of the Houston Ship Channel were closed .
cause.v | 1 | After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives . One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises . These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime %% causing %% poverty . '' Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
cause.v | 1 | He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what %% causes %% sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said .
cause.v | 1 | Circumstances alter cases . A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell . He seemed a little surprised that it should have %% caused %% any particular trouble anywhere . I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico 's history and Mississippi 's . One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us ! !
cause.v | 1 | Open your heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray ! ! For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire '' . Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they %% caused %% him to tremble . For he feared the Lake of Fire . He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; ; he must pray to be spared .
cause.v | 1 | For example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed through middle-Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs %% caused %% by his personal assaults against the English at Dunkirk . As we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian blind . And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' .
chance.n | 1 | Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more . And not just for the players . It 's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the %% chance %% to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers . `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics . Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments .
chance.n | 2 | Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a %% chance %% accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .
chance.n | 1 | If this battle were a movie , the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common . In the opener , Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $ 5 billion . Shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairmen , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the %% chance %% to run Columbia . Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner . That 's where the two scripts would diverge .
chance.n | 4 | He made numerous trips to the U.S. in the early 1980s , but was n't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-Vice President George Bush at a government function . A federal judge in Manhattan threw out the indictment , finding that the seven-year delay violated the defendant 's constitutional right to a speedy trial . The appeals court , however , said the judge did n't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the %% chances %% of a fair trial . Mr. Koskotas is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece , where he is charged with embezzling more than $ 250 million from the Bank of Crete . His attorney could n't be reached for comment .
chance.n | 1 | Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . Mr. Breeden , not missing a %% chance %% to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange .
chance.n | 4 | For fiscal 1990 , analysts expect P&G 's sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % . Lynne Hyman , vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp. , expects P&G to post net of about $ 4.20 a share , on a post-split basis . `` But I 'm recognizing there 's a good %% chance %% they 'll do a bit better than that , '' she says . In fiscal 1989 , P&G earned $ 3.56 a share , adjusted for the stock split . One big factor affecting the fiscal second half will be the new stewardship of Edwin L. Artzt , who becomes chairman and chief executive officer in January .
chance.n | 4 | The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending . The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion . `` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a %% chance %% , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president . Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories . But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
chance.n | 1 | Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a %% chance %% . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
chance.n | 1 | When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the %% chance %% . Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .

Still , a few individual companies , most likely smaller ones , could be devastated . `` I think there is a damned good %% chance %% someone is going to hit the skids on this , '' said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult . He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo . British , West German , Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster .
chance.n | 4 | Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony . `` It 's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station . You might find something , but the %% chances %% are low , '' said Michael Ellman , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co . And Eugene Glazer , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a ( prediction ) of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , infringed on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass .
claim.v | 1 | Quickview Systems Inc. said it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc. , %% claiming %% patent infringement in an element of Apple 's popular HyperCard software program . The suit , filed in Minneapolis federal court , claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display `` only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field . '' The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold .
claim.v | 2 | Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value %% claimed %% by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid . Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge . A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
claim.v | 1 | `` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles . Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds . Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel %% claimed %% , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . '' Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found . During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
claim.v | 1 | But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined . Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability . It %% claims %% the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far . The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller ( D. , Calif. ) , a sponsor of the bill .
claim.v | 1 | The list of laboratories %% claiming %% to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing . But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
claim.v | 1 | You know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was ' to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General . In his own words , Bang-Jensen ' took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public .

claim.v | 1 | Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known . It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately %% claiming %% every unsolved murder in the state . It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man .
come.v | 3 | The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves . In recent months , researchers have %% come %% to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged . Like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must be impaired .
come.v | 1 | It 's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment , a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression . The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung , '' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news . It is the New Journalism %% come %% to television . Ms. Chung 's program is just one of several network shows ( and many more in syndication ) that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events , using actors who are supposed to resemble real people , living and dead . Ms. Chung 's , however , is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors .

come.v | 1 | A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc . J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` %% come %% in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' And the winners will be the colleges , not either network . Nor , by the way , advertisers . ''
come.v | 9 | The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that %% came %% to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . But Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's market regulation chief , said he did n't believe `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing . ''
come.v | 4 | Compliance added 15 % to 20 % to her accounting bill last year , she says . SALES TAX RECORDS : Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption %% comes %% at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews . To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense . `` You need one person to just take care of sales tax , '' says Jennie Tong , executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc. , New York .

Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken . Grain , milk and meat %% come %% next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast . Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .

Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month 's elections freeing the country from South African control , De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine 's productive life for another 25 years , from the current estimate of 10 . Huge machines that look as though they %% came %% from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes . Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters ; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator , with buckets instead of seats , chews through layers of compacted sand ; tracks and conveyor belts , shuttling sand to the screening plants , criss-cross the beach . Then there is the artifical sea wall , 600 yards long and 60 yards thick , jutting into the ocean .
come.v | 2 | Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . The tip-off %% came %% when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
come.v | 2 | That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts say they think durable goods orders fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , %% coming %% after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout . Overall , he said , the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens .
come.v | 4 | `` If the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers %% came %% out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''
come.v | 1 | It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people %% came %% through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says .
come.v | 1 | The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong . Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected . Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to %% come %% . `` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co . `` Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9 % -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening .

come.v | 9 | The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second . Both of Dr. Baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution . It %% came %% to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment . They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore . Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere .

Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to %% come %% in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
come.v | 5 | The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts . Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must %% come %% from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget . That would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters . Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
come.v | 1 | He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , %% came %% on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
come.v | 2 | Parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford . Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds . That way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time %% comes %% to pay tuition . Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages . He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds .
come.v | 5 | Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
come.v | 3 | Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business . Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture . Noranda and Trelleborg each %% came %% close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf . Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
come.v | 2 | Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war . The talks %% came %% as Lebanese negotiations on political changes appeared deadlocked . GOP Sen. Specter of Pennsylvania said he would vote to acquit federal Judge Alcee Hastings in his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and bribery conspiracy . Specter , the vice chairman of the Senate 's evidence panel , said there was `` insufficient evidence to convict '' the Miami jurist .
come.v | 2 | There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve . It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey , a country that has been one of America 's strongest allies in NATO . The resolution also %% comes %% at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community . Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people ?
come.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost %% came %% to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
complain.v | 1 | At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe . Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted . So far , no ally has %% complained %% openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable , they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined .
complain.v | 1 | But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars . Critics have %% complained %% that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains . In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . '' The guidelines also state , `` The government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . ''
complain.v | 1 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president %% complained %% about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
complain.v | 1 | The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he %% complained %% , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean .

U.S. Memories investors include Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , International Business Machines Corp. , Intel Corp. , LSI Logic Corp. , and National Semiconductor Corp . Mr. Kane said he expects several other companies to join some time after the venture %% completes %% a business plan , probably later this week .
complete.v | 1 | Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government %% completed %% a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members . Sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines . The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts .

That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage . Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been %% completed %% . Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years .

GE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . The second portion will be %% completed %% the following year . GE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion .

His next major work , %% completed %% in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' .

The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a %% condition %% of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .

Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a `` significant downturn '' in the pulp and paper industry , an event that he said would temporarily dilute earnings . But he said that even under those %% conditions %% , the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger . `` The fit is so good , we see this as a time of opportunity , '' he said . Georgia-Pacific , which has suspended its stock-repurchase program , would finance the acquisition with all bank debt , provided by banks led by BankAmerica Corp .

NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto . The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other %% conditions %% . NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .
condition.n | 1 | Conversely , strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate . Indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong 's economic rhythm . Once external %% conditions %% , such as U.S. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they argue , local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual . But economic arguments , however solid , wo n't necessarily impress Hong Kong 's 5.7 million people . Many are refugees , having fled China 's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949 .
condition.n | 1 | The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities . Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market %% conditions %% turn sour . If that proves true , analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992 , when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers . With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor .
condition.n | 1 | The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute . After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees , two big bank creditors , Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working capital . But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial %% condition %% , and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn . People familiar with Monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine . Then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from Finland 's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen .

The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective . A Carbide spokesman said `` the %% conditions %% are right for the increase to hold . '' For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense . Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
condition.n | 2 | The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 . Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories . The %% conditions %% include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale . The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book . The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 .
condition.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary %% conditions %% . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .

One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on %% condition %% that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies . Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory . He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .

Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research , Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth . It cited cyclical %% conditions %% in its Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units . For the nine months , net income rose 19 % to $ 449 million , or $ 2.40 a share , from $ 375.9 million , or $ 2.01 a share , a year earlier . Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of $ 14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International .

Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday . ( Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical %% condition %% has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media . ) ADN said Mr. Honecker , a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military . Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament convenes later this week .

As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline , the unsettled %% conditions %% will frighten many investors . `` The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , '' says Henry Linsert Jr. , chairman of Martek Corp. , a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock . `` The more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain .

contribute.v | 2 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has %% contributed %% to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
contribute.v | 2 | Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have %% contributed %% to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .
contribute.v | 2 | The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee . The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday . Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends %% contribute %% to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort .

Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
defense.n | 5 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own %% defenses %% against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and management . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
defense.n | 1 | In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment . But last February , a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense . The appeals court said the %% defense %% is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision . General Dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely . General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
defense.n | 7 | All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations , Boeing said .

defense.n | 2 | Step 1 cleans up our books . Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ 100 billion . Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year %% Defense %% Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan 's final budget submission to Congress . That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion . To make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion .
defense.n | 4 | According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made . Still , criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees . They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best %% defense %% lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid .
defense.n | 1 | `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week 's interview . He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position . But there is no %% defense %% at all for the ethos of the 1980s . We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989 : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
defense.n | 4 | To take advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said , Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases . Although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort . It included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs ' lawyers and %% defense %% attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .
defense.n | 5 | She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital %% defense %% goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 . While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .
defense.n | 4 | In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg . The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury . The %% defense %% also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War . A more blue-collar panel became a second aim . Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
defense.n | 4 | During the balloting , 26 members of the 500-seat Parliament voted against Krenz , a move considered unprecedented in the country 's 40-year history . Officials in East Berlin , responding to complaints from opposition groups , admitted police used excessive force in dispersing protesters this month . The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the %% defense %% . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake .
defense.n | 4 | For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count . Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , %% defense %% attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended . There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman . Neither testified at the previous trials .

Mr. Belli , who was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night , says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse . %% Defense %% lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually . `` A lot of this is going to be code-related , '' says Ignazio J. Ruvolo , a construction law specialist at Bronson , Bronson & McKinnon , a San Francisco law firm . Plaintiffs , he says , will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards .

Revenue dropped 5.4 % to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.68 billion . This year 's nine-month results include gains of $ 13 million , or five cents a share , from the sale of Schlumberger 's %% defense %% systems business , and $ 22 million , or nine cents a share , from an award by the IranU.S .

defense.n | 7 | Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88 % , and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50 % rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin . The French electronics and %% defense %% group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ( $ 38.4 million ) , compared with 130 million francs ( $ 20.5 million ) in the corresponding period of Operating profit climbed 51 % , to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988 . Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group 's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier .
describe.v | 1 | For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses . Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers , as the management company , has paid , and have `` proved to be very important for the exchanges , '' a Farmers spokesman said . Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $ 8 million a year , which he %% described %% as `` peanuts .

'' That 's not fair ; they 're not all fat .
describe.v | 3 | It is the chief merit in Copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent . He can not , e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth 's own motion . He can not %% describe %% eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem . In Ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations . In a systematic astronomy , like that of Copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system ; ; they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .
describe.v | 1 | Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by %% describing %% in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich Auerbach 's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .

Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley %% described %% as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . Rachel wore a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . Scotty 's father sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship .
describe.v | 1 | `` O ! ! Pioneers ! ! '' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to %% describe %% how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were .

Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone . `` When I saw the Lexus sales projections , I got worried , '' confesses Takashi Oka , who led the Infiniti %% development %% team . But on reflection , Mr. Oka says , he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus . `` Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. Oka says .
development.n | 1 | According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third . The SEC 's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates . The rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and %% development %% , Mr. Lane said . The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said . Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time .
development.n | 1 | If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , Foothills said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline . It 's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects . Douglas Stoneman , vice president of Shell Canada , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down %% development %% . Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards . Instead , Richard Haskayne , president and chief executive of Interprovincial 's Calgary-based parent , Interhome Energy Inc. , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal .
development.n | 1 | And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ? An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market . For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the %% development %% of a free market . Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council ) . Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
development.n | 1 | In 1991 , the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space , the first Japanese to go into orbit . Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the U.S. , Japan 's principal ally . `` We have never opposed the %% development %% of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union , '' says a State Department official . `` Frankly , I would n't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the Soviets . '' Under Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika , the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .
development.n | 1 | P&G , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition . Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year , for example , after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics . That 's led industry executives to speculate that future product %% development %% will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands . `` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says Guy Peyrelongue , chief executive of Cosmair Inc. , the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal . `` You 'll see fewer gimmicks .

The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin , a Newport Beach , Calif. , architectural firm , to design what the Japanese press has dubbed `` the Beverly Hills of Tokyo . '' Instead of Japan 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` One Hundred Hills '' %% development %% will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots .

As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the %% development %% of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's . Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .

development.n | 1 | In addition , the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their plants . Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles . By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and %% development %% costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said . Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually , and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .

General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales . Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 %% development %% dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp .

development.n | 3 | Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by Houston Republicans on behalf of HEI Corp. of Texas to retroactively `` move '' a Missouri hospital from one county to the next to justify higher Medicare reimbursements . The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $ 1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI , which owned the hospital in Sullivan , Mo. , during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment . In a separate %% development %% , a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and Sen.

A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill , but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides . The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .

The proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow Great American to continue engaging in real estate %% development %% activities , it said . Those activities generated $ 26.1 million in operating profit last year . But according to Great American , such profits do n't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law .

Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to %% do %% significant experimentation in that country , they said . The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''
do.v | 1 | Like which are droppable and which are not . With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers . But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who %% did %% the Katzenjammer Kids . ( In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . ) `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
do.v | 1 | `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names { of the senators } will be brought out , '' Mr. Gonzalez says . This is raising eyebrows . `` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and %% do %% this , '' says Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group . `` There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position . ''
do.v | 1 | Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . `` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . I 'm not going to %% do %% anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home . But that does n't mean I 'm not going to get angry . '' Michael Eskridge , president of CNBC , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort ! Mort ! Mort ! ''
do.v | 2 | Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power . In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work . When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would %% do %% well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
do.v | 1 | Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get %% done %% . `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . `` If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
do.v | 2 | A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are %% doing %% almost as well . A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
do.v | 1 | All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads . `` The { ministry } thinks the banks do n't know what they are %% doing %% , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified . `` The { ministry } wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added . Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
do.v | 1 | These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm . Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are %% doing %% so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately . There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them . At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
do.v | 1 | He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to %% do %% it out of current income , '' he says . `` That 's crazy . '' His advice : Do n't panic .
do.v | 1 | Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're %% doing %% is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
do.v | 1 | The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group . Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air . Even rank amateurs can %% do %% it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . ''
do.v | 1 | The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently . Surely , the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten . But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has %% done %% in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end ; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories . Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists . Bulgaria 's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months , and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past .
do.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you %% doing %% planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
drug.n | 1 | Boyer and Cohen , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the Patent Office refused to grant it . That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court , leaving Cohen and Boyer holding the first patents for making recombinant DNA ( now assigned to their schools ) . Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the %% drug %% business . Genentech 's 1988 sales were $ 335 million , both from licensing and its own products .
drug.n | 1 | G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone , a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern . Searle , a unit of Monsanto Co. , said the `` beta-blocker '' high-blood-pressure %% drug %% Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals , the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo , a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France 's L'Oreal S.A .
drug.n | 1 | The Supreme Court let stand a New York court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown . The high court 's action , refusing to hear appeals by several %% drug %% companies , is likely to have a significant impact at several levels . The most immediate effect is in New York , where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state . The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug .
drug.n | 1 | Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects , Lancet , the British medical journal , reported in 1987 . However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys . The %% drug %% has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it . All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion . A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486 .
drug.n | 1 | At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress , a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $ 10 million grant for `` development , evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices , drugs and methods . '' If this passes -- a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time . It also could put the government into the RU-486 business , which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector %% drug %% industry . We do not know whether RU-486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking , uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better . ( Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills ? )
drug.n | 1 | Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan . Mr. Bergsma said Akzo hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992 . Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic %% drugs %% and veterinary products . Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. Bergsma said . Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .
drug.n | 2 | The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars . So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about . I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the %% drug %% problem . The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work .
drug.n | 2 | Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid . Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter . In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to %% drug %% cases . '' Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . '' Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
drug.n | 2 | If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world . The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive . The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace %% drugs %% posed to the moral structure of their country . Even now , the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat . I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan .
drug.n | 2 | I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by The Wall Street Journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper , to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs . Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge . A crusade of NO to the consumption of %% drugs %% is imperative . Mr. Cano is president of El Espectador , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
drug.n | 1 | A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks , Calif. , recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson . A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge , Mass . The %% drug %% is being used primarily to treat anemias . A new experiment , reported in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine , involved giving injections of Amgen 's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood . The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery .
drug.n | 1 | The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the %% drug %% 's usage for adults in March 1987 . But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
drug.n | 1 | The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on %% drug %% distribution operations .
drug.n | 2 | This is not the case . The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative . It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI 's role would be to continue targeting the major %% drug %% traffickers through our National Drug Strategy . Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market . The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) .
drug.n | 2 | PLO leader Arafat asked Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula . Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from %% drugs %% to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . '' At a meeting in Malaysia , Australia and Canada also assailed the British prime minister for criticizing the 49-nation group 's call for Pretoria to ease apartheid .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
drug.n | 1 | American Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA . No safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said . An FDA spokesperson said the %% drugs %% are still available under other brand names . Last month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit . It also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry .
drug.n | 2 | He acknowledged , however , that Washington 's `` drug-related murder rate is intolerably high . The prisons are too crowded . %% Drugs %% continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . '' Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem . But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .
drug.n | 1 | American Home Products said sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months were at record levels . Sales for the third quarter increased 6.5 % to $ 1.51 billion from $ 1.42 billion . Sales of health-care products increased 6 % in the third quarter , based in part on strong sales of prescription %% drugs %% such as Premarin , an estrogen-replacement drug , and sales of the company 's infant formula . American Home Products said net income benefited from a `` lower effective tax rate , '' reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates , and additional operations in Puerto Rico . Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company 's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1 .
drug.n | 1 | In addition , Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores . Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients . `` We believe that every %% drug %% that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a Ralph Nader affiliate . Dr. Teich said Searle is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available . According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
drug.n | 2 | A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle . A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer . Decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the %% drug %% gangs . Until then , the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted . It 's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there .
drug.n | 1 | A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh , according to researchers . The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration , and its long-term effects are unknown . But researchers say the %% drug %% , called FK-506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates . Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed world-wide each year . Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
drug.n | 1 | Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 % and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients . Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds , and that Fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants . He said that the research team had no financial stake in the %% drug %% . `` We 've known for six months the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , '' Dr. Starzl said , adding that profiting from FK-506 would n't be ethical .
drug.n | 2 | `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' Even at this early stage , %% drugs %% caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .
drug.n | 1 | Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings , bolstered by strong sales of newer , big-selling prescriptions %% drugs %% that provide hefty profit margins . Merck & Co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings ; Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22 % and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24 % . The results were in line with analysts ' expectations .
effect.n | 1 | It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air . All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material %% effect %% on the company 's strategic plan . '' Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim .
effect.n | 3 | Faced with inevitable defeat , the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban , which covers all but a fraction of 1 % of daily flights in the U.S. . The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska . Assuming final enactment this month , the prohibition will take %% effect %% 96 days later , or in early February . On a 394-21 roll call , the House adopted the underlying transportation measure . But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $ 3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs .
effect.n | 1 | Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined . The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting %% effect %% on either Boeing or its work force . The company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared with $ 53.6 billion at the end of Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ 5 billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 .
effect.n | 3 | For one thing , it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences , let alone be executed . Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice , for instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death . In fact , only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in %% effect %% in the past three years , according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Democratic staff . The last federal execution before the Supreme Court 's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963 , meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years . `` In that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a Democratic Senate staff member .
effect.n | 1 | Unless the Soviet Union collapses , German reunification is likely to require Germany 's neutralization . The implications for Britain , France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . In the least , we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the %% effects %% of tax-rate reduction on capital flows . Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan .
effect.n | 1 | It reduces the baseline by $ 169 billion . Finally , Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2 % per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion . This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering %% effects %% of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union . The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses . They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations .
effect.n | 3 | Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take %% effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . ''
effect.n | 1 | Why do you continually ignore the salubrious %% effects %% of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation ? Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a `` temporary '' reduction when it is not ? I think the reason is that you are confusing tax `` rates '' with tax `` payments . ''
effect.n | 3 | If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill , it shall be sent , together with the Objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a Law ... . ARTICLE I , SECTION 7 , CLAUSE 3 : Every Order , Resolution , or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of Adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the Same shall take %% Effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill . President Bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto . Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently they 've joined the search .
effect.n | 3 | The Soviet State Bank announced a 90 % devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions , in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency . The measure , which will take %% effect %% next Wednesday , will create a two-tier exchange rate . Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar . But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar .
effect.n | 1 | So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd. , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant . The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo . But whatever its %% effects %% on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand . Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s . Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
effect.n | 1 | The Nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down 1.2 % . The %% effects %% on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally . After plummeting 1.8 % at one point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 . In contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1 % .
effect.n | 1 | -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero %% effect %% on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers . There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .

Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side %% effects %% . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body .

effect.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any %% effect %% on us . We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . '' The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
effect.n | 1 | In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling . Last week , when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble . `` The %% effect %% of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters . Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion . Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri .
effect.n | 1 | Inmac Corp. , a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories , said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds . The company paid five cents a share in April . The directors ' action , taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday , had little or no %% effect %% on the company 's stock , which stagnated at $ 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading . Inmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share . Sales rose 12 % to $ 249.5 million from $ 222.8 million .
effect.n | 1 | Tokyo stocks , which rebounded strongly Tuesday , extended their gains yesterday , but most other Asian and Pacific markets closed sharply lower . In London , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1 . The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the %% effects %% of Tuesday night 's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market . The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses . The Financial Times 30-share index settled 27.8 points higher at 1758.5 .
effect.n | 1 | William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term %% effect %% of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product . It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways . `` It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help , '' says Beth Burnham Mace , a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill , a Lexington , Mass. , forecasting firm .
effect.n | 1 | Bank Building , which builds and equips banks , had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year , which ends Oct. 31 . On Oct. 5 , the company estimated after-tax effects on the year 's earnings would be `` at least '' $ 1.3 million . Yesterday , the company said the negative after-tax %% effect %% on earnings for the year will be about $ 3.3 million . For the nine months ended July 31 , Bank Building had a net loss of $ 1 million , on revenue of $ 66.5 million . Bank Building , which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss , said it engaged advisers to `` explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units .

effect.n | 1 | Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . Anthony J. Iaciofano , a lawyer for Burlington , said the company believes the Beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . He said that ill %% effects %% from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said .
effect.n | 1 | After touring the area , California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the Associated Press reported . The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives . But there are other long-term %% effects %% that raise serious questions about the ability of California 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor . It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ 250 million , said Charles J. O'Connell , deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation , nicknamed Caltrans . Caltrans in Sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ 500 million .
effect.n | 3 | An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35 % , Mr. Gurria said . The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans . The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of Mexico 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into %% effect %% in early China 's top film actress , Liu Xiaoqing , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in Shandong province , the People 's Daily reported .

Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night . Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would %% end %% the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army . Saturday , he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras . He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels .
end.v | 1 | The company suffered a $ 9 million loss in the third quarter , compared with net of $ 2.5 million a year earlier . Collagen dropped 2 5\/8 to 15 5\/8 on 428,000 shares . In its fiscal-first quarter %% ended %% Sept. 30 , the biomedical-products maker earned 10 cents a share , up from eight cents a share in the 1988 quarter , which included an extraordinary credit . Occupational-Urgent Care Health fell 1 3\/4 to 15 1\/2 on 354,000 shares . The company 's third-quarter earnings also rose to 10 cents a share from eight cents a share a year ago .
end.v | 1 | Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 725.8 million ) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans , bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$ 1 billion . The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year %% ending %% Tuesday . The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 . The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions wo n't affect the payment of dividends .
end.v | 1 | Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious , '' he says . The Delicious hegemony wo n't %% end %% anytime soon . New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom . Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact .
end.v | 4 | It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results . It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy . I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might %% end %% up a schoolteacher . They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses . But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
end.v | 1 | The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the European trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled . Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations , but interest and principal are paid in dollars . The bonds %% ended %% about 1\/2 point higher yesterday . Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined . West Germany 's 7 % issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01 % , while the 6 3\/4 % issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33 % .

The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % .
end.v | 1 | And catastrophes are getting ever more costly . Lloyd 's claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-rig disaster in the North Sea , for instance , may reach $ 1 billion . During the five-year period %% ended %% 1986 , roughly 80 % of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to Chatset consultants . The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now . `` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says .
end.v | 1 | Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point . New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday . As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week %% ended %% Oct. 19 .
end.v | 1 | The reason is cost . Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s . Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years %% ended %% in June of this year ; that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period . A year at Harvard now goes for $ 19,395 . By 2007 , when this year 's newborns hit campus , a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $ 300,000 , give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time .
end.v | 1 | Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change . Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz . Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II %% ended %% . Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .
end.v | 1 | There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse . The child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother . The story %% ends %% in the child 's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother . The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside . I had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .
end.v | 1 | Watson 's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty . The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures %% ends %% with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff . They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace . Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .

The freight car was cold , early in the morning . He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
enjoy.v | 1 | It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who %% enjoy %% wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) .
enjoy.v | 2 | Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up . A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which %% enjoy %% considerable backing from the Japanese government . Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .
enjoy.v | 1 | For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular March counterpart ; ; but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; ; and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; ; and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had %% enjoyed %% the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel . And like Jo March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe Jastrow , and Sadie by Max Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi .
enjoy.v | 1 | Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right . Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves . Winston %% enjoyed %% seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style . When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace . At home , he would n't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .

For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and %% enjoyed %% the usual routine of the infant . She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city 's special nursery . Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began .
enjoy.v | 1 | My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face . In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed . In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to %% enjoy %% conversing with me in rudimentary phrases . Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things . For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .
enjoy.v | 1 | My folks would n't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie . I had n't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning . But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I %% enjoyed %% it . Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie . Johnnie I suddenly realized he 'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .
estimate.v | 1 | The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published . The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed . The institute did n't %% estimate %% annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 . The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
estimate.v | 1 | The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake . The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law . By a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters , and budget analysts %% estimate %% the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress . The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991 , and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta , whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week . Going to the well of the chamber , Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted .
estimate.v | 1 | `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to %% estimate %% how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
estimate.v | 1 | At 500 yen ( $ 3.60 ) for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II . But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen ( almost $ 92 billion ) , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry . And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers %% estimate %% the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen . If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
estimate.v | 1 | Amtech Systems Inc. , Tempe , Ariz. , said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate `` substantial improvement '' over the previous fiscal year . Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are %% estimated %% at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million . Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November .
estimate.v | 1 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house %% estimated %% the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
estimate.v | 1 | New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes . Quack . The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans %% estimates %% that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range . The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .

The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . %% Estimated %% and actual results involving losses are omitted . The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .

Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington %% estimated %% that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag .

He 'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd %% estimated %% the shot had come . But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted . There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .
examine.v | 1 | In this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community . An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence . If we %% examine %% the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke . The first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society . The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .
examine.v | 1 | Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple . The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy . He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never %% examined %% ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal . The equation was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the secrets . By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings .
examine.v | 2 | Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news . No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was %% examined %% , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
exchange.n | 1 | The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants ' district . At the time , Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center . Mitsubishi built the government 's dream development , the story goes , in %% exchange %% for the official decision to locate Tokyo 's central railway station there . That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government-business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties . Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's Mitsubishi group .
exchange.n | 3 | But in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said , `` We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation . Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades . He said he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program trading and the %% exchange %% 's role in it that has raged in recent days . Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some investors want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . '' The exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We are looking for representation we have n't had , '' a specialist said . `` We 've had dictation . '' After another session Mr. Phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said , `` Clearly , the firms want the %% exchange %% to take leadership . '' Many specialist firms resent the Big Board 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index in one shot . Ultimately , the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise .
exchange.n | 5 | These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions . In an interest-rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period . In a forward-rate agreement , a client agrees to an %% exchange %% rate on a future currency transaction . Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem . Started three years ago , Chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field .
exchange.n | 3 | Wall Street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven program trading . Kidder , Peabody & Co. , a unit of General Electric Co. , announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account , and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether . At the New York Stock Exchange , which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the %% exchange %% 's own listed companies , Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board 's 49 stock specialist firms . The specialists , a trader said , were `` livid '' about Mr. Phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies are `` here to stay . '' Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market , including the 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13 .
exchange.n | 3 | Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry , the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l , 1975 . The timing for change was right . Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought %% exchange %% seats to handle their own trades . And the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks , gifts , women and junkets . Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business , with rate slashes of 35 % to 60 % below pre-May 1 levels .
exchange.n | 3 | The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading . Richard Grasso , Big Board president , last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents . Privately , %% exchange %% officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board , billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London 's . It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor 's index in a single trade . One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according to the exchange .
exchange.n | 5 | As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . To keep the %% exchange %% rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
exchange.n | 5 | At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the %% exchange %% rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS . Faced with a similar situation , Paul Volcker let the dollar soar , ( though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation ) . But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism .
exchange.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil futures marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the %% exchange %% falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange . On Friday , the Merc 's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co. 's Henry Hub in Erath , La. , as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract . It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it .
exchange.n | 3 | The Merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil , gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York , and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . In a recent interview , Mr. Thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image . Earlier this year , the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders and one clerk at the two big Chicago %% exchanges %% . Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May , though no indictments have been handed down there . So far they have issued scores of subpoenas , some of which went to members of the New York Merc .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York %% exchanges %% have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . So far there is little to show for such efforts .
exchange.n | 5 | Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate . The Treasury 's report , which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act , again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies . `` We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate ` manipulation ' '' during the past six months , it said , citing the lack of market forces in South Korea 's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate %% exchange %% rates . The Treasury expressed pleasure , however , with the government of Taiwan , which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year 's report . The Treasury said Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year .
exchange.n | 3 | On Friday , Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia 's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore . The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say . Though the split has long been expected , the %% exchanges %% are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways . The finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries . Rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .
exchange.n | 3 | Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry . Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges . Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the %% exchanges %% , the industry and ultimately the general public . One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker . The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
exchange.n | 3 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the %% exchanges %% might be closed . He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
exchange.n | 1 | Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` %% exchange %% of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power . But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock .
exchange.n | 3 | When the going gets tough , it 's tough to trade stocks in continental Europe . That 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence . They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European %% exchanges %% trade stocks . The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on London 's stock exchange , which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries . `` I 'm not saying London covered itself in glory , but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe 's weaknesses , '' says Stewart Gilchrist , a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which manages about # 6 billion ( $ 9.63 billion ) in institutional money .
exchange.n | 5 | Your Sept. 25 criticism of credit-card foreign-exchange charges is unwarranted . I have just returned from France , and the net %% exchange %% rate charged on my Visa account was more favorable than I obtained for traveler 's checks in any of the several banks where I converted them . Vincent Jolivet Kenmore , Wash .
exchange.n | 5 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed %% exchange %% rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .
exchange.n | 5 | By contrast , in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose , much as it would in today 's Soviet Union . The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law , rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency . It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914 , when the Bank of England was an independent private bank , the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended , but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England , the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of %% exchange %% declined . The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency . One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws .

All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp. , which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year .

exchange.n | 3 | The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago %% exchange %% 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .
exchange.n | 3 | Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock %% exchanges %% late yesterday afternoon at the company 's request , Toronto Stock Exchange officials said . Brian Hemming , a spokesman for the company 's committee of independent directors , established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company , said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning . But Mr. Hemming said he was n't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers .
exchange.n | 5 | The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , `` as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . '' Overseas sales were stronger , principally because of a rebound in Brazil , where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results , Johnson & Johnson said . Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable %% exchange %% rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter . He cautioned , however , that a `` tough tax-rate comparison '' may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter . For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said .
exchange.n | 3 | Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume . September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the %% exchange %% began making such figures public in July 1988 . A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever . The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies .

Unease is widespread among %% exchange %% members . `` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 . `` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
exchange.n | 3 | Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . The magnitude of the %% exchange %% 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
exchange.n | 1 | Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share %% exchanges %% has grown among European carriers . `` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says . `` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
exchange.n | 1 | It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents . Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from %% exchange %% agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .

IS REQUIRED to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plans . Under guidelines included in an %% exchange %% of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives . The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said .
exchange.n | 3 | The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign %% exchange %% market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . Late in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York . The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday .
exchange.n | 1 | In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department . But there was one bright spot yesterday . The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in %% exchange %% for an ownership stake . The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .

exchange.n | 3 | In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange . The decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake . The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the %% exchange %% could be traded today and tomorrow . SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market . Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American , New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE , where they would continue making markets in the Pacific-listed options .

Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. %% exchanges %% , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .
exchange.n | 3 | Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders . The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . The %% exchanges %% say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them .

Second , it %% explains %% why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .

What is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels . Although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise '' , `` individual initiative '' , `` the democratic way '' , `` government of the people '' , `` competition of the marketplace '' , etc. , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen 's confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground '' .
explain.v | 1 | When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities . This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg . His London contract was rescinded , and now , he %% explains %% cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts '' ! ! Our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro 's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe . As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .
explain.v | 1 | McFeeley looked puzzled . Kahler continued : `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he 's sore , so I expected him to come barging in '' . Mr. Kahler went on to %% explain %% how Hausman 's fox terrier had been `` making '' in his flower beds . The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers . He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he 'd let fly with a cherry bomb .
explain.v | 1 | `` Whatever you say '' . Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered . `` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to %% explain %% that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . `` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly . `` He 'll know when you tell him .
explain.v | 1 | It was simply Poor John . There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either . Mousie Chandler had been to school with her someplace near Baltimore and tried to %% explain %% rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at Horne 's . `` Well , you should n't underestimate Edythe '' , Mousie said . `` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained .
explain.v | 1 | He started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading . He was knocking down checks at faro '' . `` I 'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen %% explained %% . `` Something about the pollen '' . `` Well , okay '' , Buzz said .
express.v | 1 | South Africa 's government said peaceful demonstrations such as the anti-apartheid rally Sunday near Soweto have helped ease tensions and assisted political changes . About 70,000 people attended the anti-government rally , at which leaders of the banned African National Congress refused to renounce violence to end apartheid . Secretary of State Baker %% expressed %% concern that Nicaraguan President Ortega may attempt to use alleged attacks by the U.S.backed Contra rebels as an excuse to scuttle elections scheduled for February . Ortega had threatened to end a 19-month-old ceasefire . Baker 's remarks came as the White House urged both sides to honor the truce .
express.v | 1 | Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . But for the most part , officials have avoided %% expressing %% those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
express.v | 1 | One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can %% express %% themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
express.v | 1 | New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how . Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . They give strict interpretation to William James ' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to %% express %% itself '' . They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new . Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .
express.v | 1 | These are not , however , differences in federal structure . The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles . The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 %% expressed %% , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens . Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789 `` we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America '' . Confederate Constitution , 1861 `` We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America '' .
express.v | 1 | Where we end our journey is always the same . We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion '' . This was how Alexander Brandel %% expressed %% pure Zionism . It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it . In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
feel.v | 1 | With all this , even the most wary oil men agree something has changed . `` It does n't appear to be getting worse . That in itself has got to cause people to %% feel %% a little more optimistic , '' says Glenn Cox , the president of Phillips Petroleum Co . Though modest , the change reaches beyond the oil patch , too . The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .
feel.v | 1 | Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible . The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable . For the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must %% feel %% represented . One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency . As is , blacks constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elected leaders .
feel.v | 3 | Cadillac may be on to something . Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag . More than 50 % %% felt %% the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal .
feel.v | 1 | He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million . The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . But in general , all foreign-trading companies are %% feeling %% the pinch . `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
feel.v | 1 | Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . `` They may %% feel %% emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . `` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . '' Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
feel.v | 1 | The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they %% felt %% extended to them by the mother country . And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
feel.v | 1 | Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one 's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one 's parents ' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger . I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one %% feels %% , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm .
feel.v | 1 | 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were %% felt %% with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
feel.v | 3 | The most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself . Despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself . Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who %% feel %% themselves to be among the ruling class . Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change . Since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .
feel.v | 1 | Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe %% felt %% a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago . The New England conscience became desensitized .
feel.v | 3 | Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states . After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union . He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he %% felt %% that necessity left him no other way to save the Union . In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : `` In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' . What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .
feel.v | 1 | Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it . `` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not %% feel %% entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' . With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Scotty was neutral . He did not resent their supervision or Virginia 's sometimes tiring sympathy . He ate what he %% felt %% like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . His energy was gone . He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving .
feel.v | 2 | Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we could n't get in ? ? Suppose I had n't brought along enough money ? ? I %% felt %% for my wallet . Its thick , substantial outline calmed me . But when I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong .
feel.v | 3 | He might not have gone that far if Pa had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house . That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it . I always %% felt %% the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs . Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach .
feel.v | 1 | Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He %% felt %% a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
feel.v | 1 | And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street . I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship . I %% felt %% it and it ate on me all the time , but I did n't know how right I was till later . What I did know was that Precious was always around . He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs .
feel.v | 3 | Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school . He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry . Kate %% felt %% she had deserted the boy in her own loss . She loved him and missed his company . Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .
feel.v | 2 | He felt them . They were damp . He reached out and %% felt %% the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub . Damp also . He looked around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick '' ? ?
feel.v | 1 | We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . Whatever we %% felt %% about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming . The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .
feel.v | 1 | Remember that He heard himself haranguing them . He saw himself before them delivering the speech . He laughed , suddenly , %% feeling %% a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention . One day , Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work '' . He would ! !
feel.v | 1 | He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . Still , the sensation always surprised him . It was a thrill he %% felt %% no part in . He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things . He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
feel.v | 1 | Hello , Mike . My , you look chipper '' . `` I %% feel %% fine ! ! Where is everybody '' ? ? `` Asleep .
feel.v | 1 | This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh -- a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . Mercer got the blissful needle . When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he %% felt %% the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body . He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
feel.v | 1 | Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock . He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide . It was the only thing in his life for which he %% felt %% guilt . Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see . Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
feel.v | 1 | Such a pitiful end '' ! ! Though the slave 's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner 's panel , Dandy 's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded . The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did n't %% feel %% privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady . Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans ' dives . So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine 's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .
feel.v | 1 | `` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us . He looked as if he was going to keel over . I %% felt %% a queasiness in my own stomach but it would n't do to show these girls that we were afraid . Not so soon , anyway . I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .
feel.v | 1 | He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg %% felt %% himself developing a case of claustrophobia . The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in . If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
feel.v | 1 | By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them . No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal . Even strange names seemed to make them %% feel %% closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness . Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .
feel.v | 1 | Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed . Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ? Pamela %% felt %% calm and peaceful as she walked along . The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear . She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
feel.v | 1 | It sprang from a type of mentality I 'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here . I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed . I %% felt %% strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance . I lived in a state of suspense because of it . I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to .
feel.v | 1 | On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age . %% Feeling %% suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human . Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
feel.v | 3 | Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers . Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . He %% felt %% that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor . Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts . Sooner or later , Dolores would crack .
feel.v | 1 | I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance . It was no use . I %% felt %% myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .
feel.v | 3 | She got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick . Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and %% felt %% themselves to be so . Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits . `` No '' , said Theresa .
feel.v | 1 | I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night 's melancholy . My head was clear . I was hungry as a wolf , and my body %% felt %% lean and vital . `` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .
feel.v | 3 | Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile . Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one . He was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people %% felt %% , because they knew that money must be a problem to him . But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company . The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary .
feel.v | 1 | She stood , once more listening . She had never been here at this hour . She %% felt %% as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her . If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .
feel.v | 1 | I will simply kill you first . Now go '' ! ! The other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger %% felt %% . They picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl . The sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs .
feel.v | 1 | If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . I love you , I hate you , I %% feel %% like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you 're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . So I went about my business . I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
feel.v | 1 | The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't %% feel %% lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . In a way , Askington was right .
feel.v | 1 | It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing . He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day . So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , %% feeling %% . If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever . You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .
feel.v | 1 | She sighed a dirty word and left . Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance . She sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen %% felt %% sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support . A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde 's place . He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .
feel.v | 1 | He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again . Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank . Mr. Robards laughed , said he 'd %% feel %% a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her . `` You could try . And if I ever hear you say ' Mist Laban ' again I 'll scream .
find.v | 1 | Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible . Dr. Knudson %% found %% that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer .
find.v | 1 | The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass . Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland , have %% found %% that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies . The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer . The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer .
find.v | 1 | One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment , reflecting service companies ' hunger for work . Kadane Oil Co. , a small Texas independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others . One of its wells , in southwestern Oklahoma , is a `` rank wildcat , '' a risky well where oil previously has n't been %% found %% . `` At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good , '' says George Kadane , head of the company . `` If you know you 've got stability in price , you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years . ''
find.v | 1 | The session failed to enact any new curbs . Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape . Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration %% finds %% itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
find.v | 1 | Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it %% found %% no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending . The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited .

Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial .

future.n | 4 | When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later , some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy . Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed . If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his %% future %% , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika .
future.n | 3 | Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , the leading Wall Street firm in the home-equity securities market , which was created early this year . Municipal Issues The improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the New York City sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and Tbond %% futures %% continued to grow more negative . The MOB spread , or difference between the municipal and T-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand . December municipal futures ended up 11\/32 point to 92-14 , having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded .

On top of that , the Blue Bell , Pa. , concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees .
future.n | 3 | Separately , Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security . Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for %% futures %% than for stocks . Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility . These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .

future.n | 3 | The New York Mercantile Exchange , the world 's chief oil %% futures %% marketplace , is at a critical juncture . Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules . If the exchange falters in these moves , they say , it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor , the Commodity Exchange .
future.n | 1 | `` If we do n't do something ... we wo n't be able to catch up with demand , '' says a Dentsu spokesman . `` Our president said acquisition is an effective method . '' Last year , Dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than 10 % of total billings , but the company is aiming at 20 % in the near %% future %% . So far , it appears cautious about taking the big step . For example , the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC .
future.n | 3 | The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. %% futures %% exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision . Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are . The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
future.n | 3 | The Fed also has the power to set margin requirements . But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ? Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the %% futures %% market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle . The foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger .
future.n | 3 | The real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices , they say , might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures . A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . Since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index %% futures %% rivals that in the stocks themselves . The conventional view , as voiced by Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' But increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors .
future.n | 3 | Essentially , the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps . One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility ; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital . `` Before %% futures %% , '' says New York investor Michael Harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value . '' While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices , traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks . When Chicago futures prices jump up or down , the New York Stock Exchange follows .
future.n | 3 | It 's too disruptive , '' he says . `` It is n't investing . '' But stock-index %% futures %% have plenty of support . Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
future.n | 3 | Futures , he says , merely cut down on trading costs . He says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . '' Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the %% futures %% and stock markets , it ca n't add to volatility , he says . Futures `` do n't need defending , '' says Andrew Yemma , a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which trades the S&P 500 , by far the largest stock-index futures contract . Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear .
future.n | 3 | `` All life is about change -- either you adapt or die , '' says one Chicago futures trader . `` If futures are n't permitted here , we 'll take it to Australia or Tokyo . '' Average daily volume in S&P 500 %% futures %% last year was 44,877 contracts . Based on yesterday 's closing price of the S&P , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ 7.6 billion . By contrast , average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $ 5.3 billion .
future.n | 3 | Many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios . If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts . And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street , one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on %% futures %% as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions . One reason futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down . Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 % .
future.n | 3 | The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . But owning index %% futures %% is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
future.n | 3 | If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong . `` The contract is definitely important to the exchange , '' says Robert Gilmore , executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission . Two years ago , the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be %% futures %% centers . After only 17 months , its main contract , based on the Hang Seng index , had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world . { A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date .
future.n | 3 | Despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is likely to start slowly . The wounds from the 1987 crash have n't yet healed , and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled . Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its %% futures %% market . And Mr. Gilmore cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency . He says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day .

future.n | 3 | Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength . A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices . Wheat %% futures %% prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis . Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment . As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .
future.n | 3 | The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month , and is expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said .

future.n | 3 | `` There was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P %% futures %% in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath . Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index . The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 3 | `` It was whooosh ! '' said one futures trader . In five minutes , the Dow industrials climbed almost 30 points . The big %% futures %% buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the Dow 's loss to 31 points by 11 a.m . Traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders . These firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit .

Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a barrel for December delivery .

future.n | 3 | Friday 's Market Activity Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading . Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks . But there were fewer price swings than expected . Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange .
future.n | 3 | `` It 's traders squaring positions . It 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . '' Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices . The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday . The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 1 | Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable %% future %% . '' However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
future.n | 3 | That sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn . By some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn . By buying %% futures %% contracts , these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver . Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts . Among other things , the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union .

'' Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses %% futures %% in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says .
future.n | 3 | The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7 % of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10 . Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index %% futures %% and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying .
future.n | 3 | The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday . The CBOE , American Stock Exchange , Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett , owner of Fossett , joined in putting up $ 50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options . The head of another small options clearing firm , who asked not to be identified , said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and %% futures %% business . Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s , most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next . Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms .
future.n | 1 | But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts . `` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said . `` Now , they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the %% future %% and that means rate increases . '' Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed . Safeco fell 1\/8 to 32 5\/8 on 462,900 shares .
future.n | 4 | The stock tumbled 24 7\/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares . The market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers . UAL , which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks would n't finance , represents the %% future %% of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market - corporate restructuring . An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds , used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks . `` It was a very nervous day , '' said John Geary , partner of the Big Board specialist firm Ziebarth , Geary .
future.n | 3 | But in October 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . Yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets . Others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and %% futures %% . Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . But institutions say Wall Street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets .
future.n | 3 | The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said . LIVESTOCK AND MEATS : The prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly %% futures %% contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork . The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday . Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef .
future.n | 3 | After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index %% futures %% pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .
future.n | 3 | They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss . The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses . Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index %% futures %% . But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . CBOE Chairman Alger `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade .
go.v | 7 | Greece and Turkey , for example , are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other . Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals . `` It 's just %% going %% to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs { the Warsaw Pact 's } , '' says one NATO analyst . So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed . They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude .
go.v | 10 | `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he says . Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem %% goes %% beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power .
go.v | 7 | He got three trucks and a backhoe cheap . `` I want to add one more truck , '' Mr. Huber says . I sense that it 's %% going %% to continue to grow . That 's the word . The word is out .
go.v | 1 | It has been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to %% go %% into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) .
go.v | 2 | No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . `` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' ESPN 's Mr. Werner says . `` If the show ai n't a killer , they 're %% gone %% . '' During the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC touted `` Call to Glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks . Last October , during the 1988 Summer Games , NBC relentlessly pitched a new series , `` Tattingers . ''
go.v | 7 | `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia . The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's %% going %% to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders .
go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
go.v | 14 | Felix Siemienas is destroying it now . He packs pork . A law %% went %% on the books in January that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs . He cashed in . Poland is short on enterprises , not enterprise .
go.v | 7 | `` This is beautiful stuff , '' he says , looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn . `` But I 'm going to lose $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 on it . I 'm %% going %% to have to get another job this year just to eat . '' Besides rotten prices , he has been hit recently by hail , a bark-nibbling horde of mice , fungi and bugs . Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer .
go.v | 11 | In July unfilled orders grew 1 % . But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . `` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us %% going %% . That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. Kleinman said . `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . ''
go.v | 1 | Garry Kasparov %% went %% to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack .
go.v | 7 | They 're in the midst of a turnaround , '' she noted . Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year . A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is %% going %% to have people coming and going . '' Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 . Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp .
go.v | 14 | Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses . For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions . Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank %% goes %% about development , financial markets have confidence in it . This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms . Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
go.v | 2 | They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . '' Indeed , the stakes are high . The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to %% go %% for related products . HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .
go.v | 7 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're %% going %% to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
go.v | 1 | The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $ 1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds . By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) and his party 's largest state delegation in the House . `` I have no regrets about %% going %% forward , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio ( D. , Calif. ) , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting . `` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . '' The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
go.v | 14 | `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . `` On the other hand , we have economic news that is { expected to be } relatively positive for the bond market . We will %% go %% back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
go.v | 7 | The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m . CNBC is available to 13 million cable households . Mr. Downey said he is not %% going %% to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . `` But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . I 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home .
go.v | 1 | David Baltimore , who has just been named president of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to %% go %% through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name . The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .
go.v | 7 | `` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco . `` It 's like kicking the tires of a car ... . What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car %% going %% to perform ? '' General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended Thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . But Lipper Analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations .
go.v | 1 | But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing . `` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . `` Cathay would love to keep %% going %% , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
go.v | 1 | But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires . It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it . Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will %% go %% up sharply because you 're that much older . So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .
go.v | 7 | Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? `` You 're not %% going %% to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
go.v | 14 | In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way . Using it , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner ? Other cases %% go %% to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner . Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County .
go.v | 14 | The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . Franchisees ca n't be forced to %% go %% along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
go.v | 7 | '' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . Those enterprises , however , are not %% going %% to be privatized . They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . ''
go.v | 1 | Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . Smith-Kline Beecham %% goes %% further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .
go.v | 1 | Bush has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future Supreme Court nominees . Conservatives now hold only a 5-4 edge . One slot is expected to %% go %% to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas , a black conservative ; after mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against him . Other conservatives thought to be on the administration 's short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann , who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department , and Marshall Breger , chairman of a U.S. agency on administration . The Bush administration would also like to nominate a woman ; one possibility is former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing .
go.v | 4 | `` If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it , but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration , then these are two contradictions that ca n't go on forever , '' says Mr. Verwoerd . He is sitting in his living room , beneath a huge portrait of his late father , Hendrik F. Verwoerd , apartheid 's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 . Somewhere , the son sighs , things %% went %% terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation . `` People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it . But my father meant it to mean real separation , '' says the son .
go.v | 1 | `` Unfortunately , '' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . '' The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death . `` I think if we had been allowed to %% go %% ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. Sanford says . `` If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . '' In August 1983 , Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos .
go.v | 2 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon %% went %% away , while the shah -- he kept coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
grant.v | 1 | A federal judge %% granted %% a temporary stay of the California Student Aid Commission 's emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for National Technical Schools , a unit of United Education & Software Inc . The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards , and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations . United Education & Software , a Los Angeles education services company , called the commission 's action `` precipitous and unwarranted . ''
grant.v | 2 | When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of course , was the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I %% grant %% , has a definite place in our society . But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .
hold.v | 8 | A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight people and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said . The blast , which wrecked the opposition labor group 's offices , was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador 's 10-year-old civil war . Hungary 's Parliament voted to %% hold %% a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president . The balloting to decide when and how to fill the position , which replaces a collective presidency under a pact signed by the ruling Socialists and opposition groups , is to be held Nov . The State Department denied asylum to a Vietnamese man who escaped from his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder housing of a tanker for two days in monsoon seas .
hold.v | 5 | Under the direction of its new chairman , Francisco Luzon , Spain 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization . The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior . The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , %% holds %% 8.42 % . The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .
hold.v | 5 | It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan 's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan . The latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression . In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently %% held %% raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake .
hold.v | 2 | The Senate voted to authorize $ 4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year , but the House , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion . Despite the widening gap between the two sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference . That would %% hold %% spending on the program at about the previous year 's level . The decision to keep the embattled F-14 's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the House , and especially for Rep. Les Aspin ( D. , Wis . ) . As the head of the House conferees , Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production .
hold.v | 8 | Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas . California 's insurance commissioner does n't %% hold %% hearings on acquisition applications . Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa . He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define policies and strategies of the group . ''
hold.v | 4 | Medieval philosophers used to %% hold %% the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
hold.v | 5 | GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs . Scores of other credit programs , subsidizing agriculture , small business , exporters , defense , energy , transportation and others , are less visible but in no better shape . If the programs continue their present path , the potential government losses are staggering : The federal government %% holds %% $ 222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantees . ( Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion . ) Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs .
hold.v | 5 | For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion . Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month . As of Aug. 31 , thrifts %% held %% $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities . The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
hold.v | 8 | `` They are typically not active in two-year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal . '' However , Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline . He said , `` Possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the ( quarterly ) refunding '' of government debt to be %% held %% next month by the Treasury . A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two-year notes . Treasury , Agency Securities
hold.v | 8 | The House Appropriations Committee approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the quake region , less than the $ 3.8 billion sought by California officials . Hungary declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the Soviet Union . A crowd estimated at 100,000 %% held %% a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman said .
hold.v | 8 | The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday . SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah . Burmah said it had n't %% held %% any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .
hold.v | 5 | That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam %% held %% a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .
hold.v | 5 | But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , says zeros are particularly ill-suited . Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . That wo n't matter if they are %% held %% to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better .

It noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .
hold.v | 4 | While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it explains why voters %% hold %% Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .

hope.v | 1 | While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) said yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . '' Sen. Dole also said he %% hoped %% for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader . While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue . `` The administration should now state that if the { February } election is voided by the Sandinistas ... they should call for military aid , '' said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams .
hope.v | 1 | Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring . And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded . Two bills in Congress %% hope %% to make such restrictions national . In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D.

( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . )

Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies %% hoped %% to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing . Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' ( North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 ) is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .

USX and Kobe Steel %% hope %% to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
hope.v | 1 | The battle is not easy . We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders . Persons developed in today 's corporations can not %% hope %% to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do . Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .

job.n | 2 | Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their %% jobs %% . Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers .

The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September 's 209,000 increase . But the important factory-jobs segment , which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events .

Many economic-development officials say the Koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank %% jobs %% from moving across the Hudson . But Mr. Dinkins 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support . Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable .

By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room , Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs . The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 %% jobs %% , 95,400 of them in the tourist industry . Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms . Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage .

Not to mention a generous federal pension . There is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $ 10,000 a pop , at tony places including the Yale Political Union .
job.n | 1 | And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets , by making it harder to arrange takeover financing , has eased some of the pressure on Mr. Corry , it does n't end the takeover threat . `` I know it 's not over , '' a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd. , USX 's partner in a steel mill in Lorain , Ohio . In fact , it 's barely begun for Mr. Corry , who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new %% job %% . `` He 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own , '' says Bryan Jacoboski , a securities analyst at PaineWebber Inc . The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive .
job.n | 1 | Francis D. John , 35-year-old president , will assume the additional %% job %% of chief executive officer . He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .

job.n | 1 | `` In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . '' What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots . Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's %% job %% classifications into Federal 's . Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers . These groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force .
job.n | 1 | He had been president of the international operations . Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP . Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express %% job %% . Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold . Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
job.n | 1 | The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . '' Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End RECENT LAW school graduates are starting %% jobs %% with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class . Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school . `` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course .
job.n | 1 | This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . An additional benefit is the creation of %% jobs %% . This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers . It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job .
job.n | 3 | If you think you have stress-related problems on the %% job %% , there 's good news and bad news . You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
job.n | 1 | And that 's a problem . Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . `` I hope he grows with the %% job %% , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
job.n | 2 | The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . All told , Mr. Parker does a better %% job %% of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . But there are grounds for complaint . At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro .
job.n | 1 | His Levinson Institute in Belmont , Mass. , has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program . Employers foot the bill , he says , figuring what 's good for the couple is good for the company . One East Coast manufacturing executive , faced with a %% job %% transfer his wife resented , found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move . And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage . More dual-career couples also are getting help , with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling .

Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . She says it 'd create 600 %% jobs %% and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''

job.n | 2 | Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . `` If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? '' She said , `` I would say K mart 's number one %% job %% is to address its market-share loss { in discount stores } , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins . At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' But K mart 's Mr. Antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses .

join.v | 2 | On Aug. 1 , the state tore up its controls , and food prices leaped . Without buffer stocks , inflation exploded . That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and %% joined %% with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government . But by the time Solidarity took office in September , the damage was done . `` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
join.v | 3 | And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties . Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North . The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , %% joined %% with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . '' No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it . What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
join.v | 2 | Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to %% join %% the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
join.v | 4 | The gathering is expected to focus on curbing the fouling of rivers and lakes , limiting damage from industrial accidents and improving the handling of harmful chemicals . West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said Bonn is convinced of the need for cooperation , `` especially with our neighbors in the East , because we are directly affected by their ecological progress or lack of it . '' The U.S. and Canada %% joined %% every European country except Albania at the meeting . The Swedish publishers of a new Estonian-language newspaper rushed an extra edition across the Baltic on Oct. 10 after the first run sold out in one day .

join.v | 1 | As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities . In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras %% joined %% under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor . In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini 's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .
join.v | 3 | He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner . The area was deserted . A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike 's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to %% join %% the confused activity at the east end of the stockade . Mike crawled to the door and peered in . The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
join.v | 2 | They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about . There was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss 's wife and son to %% join %% the outfit . It especially bothered the older hands . The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .
keep.v | 8 | Oleg A. Grinevsky , the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks , argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks , while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe . But the issue is stickier than it seems . France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to %% keep %% out of the talks . And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter , more transportable , high-technology tanks . Defining combat aircraft is even tougher .
keep.v | 1 | Still , some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are %% keeping %% mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` European companies are looking to buy American ones , '' said Henry King , the managing partner at that firm . `` But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions . ''
keep.v | 8 | Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose . They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses . Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and %% keep %% unscrupulous competitors away , '' says Sidney West , president of TechDesign International Inc. , a Springfield , Va. , business that designs telecommunication and other products . Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . '' Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules .
keep.v | 4 | Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle , chew and romp through growers ' nightmares , including maggots , mites , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer . Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always %% keep %% the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , says Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples .
keep.v | 1 | The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams . Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year . `` Those kinds of issues always %% keep %% coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office . DESPITE VICTORIES this year , small business fears losing parental-leave war . Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
keep.v | 8 | If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . Then , in 1988 , a proposal to %% keep %% better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members .
keep.v | 4 | Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day . That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to %% keep %% prices from eroding further . The group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990 . With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices .
keep.v | 8 | But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing . `` My feeling is { Cathay does n't } have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . `` Cathay would love to %% keep %% going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
keep.v | 5 | Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person %% keep %% an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . It also adds to the mystery of the venture . Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
keep.v | 1 | Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already ! We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we %% keep %% disposing of it . Bank it ? Not really !
keep.v | 1 | To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates . Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South . To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to %% keep %% such Democrats in office . Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House . Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
keep.v | 1 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he %% kept %% coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
keep.v | 8 | Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; ; they are priceless even though they can not be recorded on a ledger page ; ; they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will %% keep %% the sheriff away '' . That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . Criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .
keep.v | 1 | He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
keep.v | 1 | Times Square , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey . Heavy-coated , severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic . The night was cold but the crowd %% kept %% one warm . The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner . Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one 's ears were continually serenaded by the horns ' rasps and bleats .
keep.v | 1 | She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she %% kept %% herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked . She walked back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . There is a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind .
keep.v | 8 | Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle . On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island . The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , %% kept %% his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets . They often threw tidbits overboard . The larger ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City .
keep.v | 4 | Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade . He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to %% keep %% it from blowing in his eyes . Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below .

And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride . He handed the bayonet to Dean and %% kept %% the pistol . `` Stay well back of me '' , he said . `` I 'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I 'm one of the guerrillas .
keep.v | 1 | Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him . Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang . They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , %% kept %% him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses . Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort . On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn 's ranch .
keep.v | 5 | If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he %% keep %% the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
keep.v | 1 | Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now . Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing . Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to %% keep %% her thoughts off Tom Brannon . Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday . He 'd come alone , without his wife and child .
keep.v | 1 | Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be %% kept %% dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
keep.v | 1 | Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him . The Allstates Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism . Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy 's instinct was to %% keep %% growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . With Herberet 's blessing , he was convinced that Allstates ' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind . At that point William came into the picture .
keep.v | 8 | `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to %% keep %% up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
keep.v | 1 | I huddled miserably beside him in the truck . It was all my doing -- his seeing her . Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to %% keep %% it . At first , Johnnie had n't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ? But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that 's how you want it , that 's how it 'll be '' .
keep.v | 3 | Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it was n't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . But I must n't start on Alice . She is a closed book , a picture I %% keep %% on my bureau , but never look at . If she 'd kept on as she 'd been going , the story I 'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , Gladdy 's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .
keep.v | 8 | He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day . John was good at his job . It probably was n't hard for him to %% keep %% his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to . Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John 's first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of Edythe . But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John 's success at his work only made Edythe 's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring .
keep.v | 1 | Then they took a taxi to Trastevere . `` There 's a church you should see '' , she said . And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to %% keep %% a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto . He let her tell him all about the church . Then they had dinner .

keep.v | 4 | Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home . However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to %% keep %% my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . When I arrived at Viola 's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook 's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .
keep.v | 3 | `` Ah , you 're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' . Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . I now felt it wiser to %% keep %% Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around . Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory .

kill.v | 4 | President Bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority . Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to %% kill %% individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill . He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto .
kill.v | 1 | He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody . `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially %% kill %% all infected cells . But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara .
kill.v | 1 | As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi . It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal . Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will %% kill %% a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
kill.v | 1 | Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . `` When elephants start fighting , ants get %% killed %% , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
kill.v | 1 | AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK Northern California , %% killing %% more than 50 people . The violent temblor , which lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale , also caused the collapse of a 30-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and shook Candlestick Park . The tremor was centered near Hollister , southeast of San Francisco , and was felt as far as 200 miles away .
kill.v | 1 | No one would question such an errand . The bottle was filled up with flour . Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward 's home , where Key had once been %% killed %% . Now it would have another death . From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry .
kill.v | 1 | It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so . I believed him . They %% killed %% Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago . My men , they all left me . Just cleared out .

You %% killed %% him , did n't you '' ? ? `` It was Brenner 's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose . `` He found out about you and Arbuckle talking .
kill.v | 1 | I meant him no harm . I 've given willful hurt to no man . I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he 's going to %% kill %% me . Beat me to death in front of a hundred people . Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .
kill.v | 1 | The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . You beauty , I said , I could n't %% kill %% you . You are much too beautiful . I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .
kill.v | 1 | The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . I 'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to %% kill %% it at last , for it could never live . The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . `` It 's a big snake , is n't it '' ? ? He said .
kill.v | 1 | Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wo n't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and %% kill %% her , and that is being an old maid too . It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull . And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .
lead.v | 1 | Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer . Recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too . Where these discoveries will %% lead %% , scientists can only speculate . Already two major pharmaceutical companies , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies . Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes .
lead.v | 2 | Senate Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the %% leading %% Senate proposal . Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House . Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
lead.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could %% lead %% to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
lead.v | 4 | It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , %% led %% by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states . But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
lead.v | 2 | Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 . Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said %% leading %% advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group . Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction . The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
lead.v | 2 | In this case , China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $ 8.7 billion , based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20 % and exports 10 % . If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit . But since June , foreign bankers %% led %% by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China . Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before . In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China 's deteriorating political and economic environment .
lead.v | 4 | It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would %% lead %% a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
lead.v | 2 | He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . '' There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis . The %% leading %% contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs . And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election . Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in .
lead.v | 2 | MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will %% lead %% the underwriters . Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\/casino and theme park .
lead.v | 1 | Unlike the other nations of the bloc , East Germany is a creature of the Cold War . Erasing the differences still dividing Europe , and the vast international reordering that implies , wo n't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary . But it could ultimately %% lead %% to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map . Which is what the Old Guard fears . `` I 'm sure they 'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR 's future as a separately identifiable state , '' says Michael Simmons , a British journalist whose book on East Germany , entitled `` The Unloved Country , '' was published this month .
lead.v | 4 | Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . `` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has %% led %% Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . `` The Americans have left him without a way out . It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
lead.v | 4 | This showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle . The misery of Miriam 's bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with Miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain . To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes %% led %% by Miriam in person . One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June . At this time Miriam Noel appeared , urging on Constable Henry Pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood .
lead.v | 1 | The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( C ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank . These assumptions %% lead %% to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel . The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men . This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .
lead.v | 1 | But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself . Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement . It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , %% leading %% to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground . This became a dance called Prelude To Flight . A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .
lead.v | 4 | Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat . Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney . Mrs. Hewlitt %% led %% the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout . Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life .
lead.v | 5 | John stood above him , his face ashen . What now ? ? Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli 's hand and %% led %% him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned . `` Plot '' ? ? John asked tiredly . `` Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit .
lead.v | 4 | Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century . He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890 's . %% Led %% by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . Bill Doolin 's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him . Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
lead.v | 5 | Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily .

Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .

maintain.v | 2 | That would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy U.S. oil executives still regard as too low a level . Patrick J . Early , president of Amoco Corp. 's oil-production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending . The view of some others in Big Oil , he %% maintains %% , `` is very much { similar to } Amoco 's outlook . '' Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations . Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun .
maintain.v | 1 | Although external events have contributed to the morass , the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs . To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide , credit policy must : 1 . Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets , not to provide subsidies . There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and %% maintaining %% the integrity of a credit program . If the program is meant to provide a subsidy , collecting the debt defeats the original goal . Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time .
maintain.v | 1 | Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom %% maintain %% close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
maintain.v | 1 | The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages . The future of the forest remains uncertain . Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be %% maintained %% . After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment . They 're more worried about bread on the table .
maintain.v | 1 | If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that . Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is %% maintained %% for 10 years . But Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies . And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
maintain.v | 2 | And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ; but many historians %% maintain %% that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .
maintain.v | 2 | Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never %% maintained %% that sex was all . Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .
maintain.v | 1 | It was , to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted . If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves . Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they %% maintained %% proficiency in their technical work . On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the A[fj] . Her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship .
management.n | 2 | First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share . Secondly , the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications . Finally , Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller 's %% management %% beyond taking a place on the board . `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi . Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
management.n | 2 | At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders , who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time . One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco . Pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current %% management %% enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner . Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc. , a diversified holding company . The State of Wisconsin Investment Board , which owned about 7 % of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
management.n | 2 | `` The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation '' in the paper industry , said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . `` I do n't think anyone is now immune from takeover , '' said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc. , Chicago . He added : `` Every paper company %% management %% has to be saying to itself , ` Before someone comes after me , I 'm going to go after somebody .

management.n | 2 | The extent of Marriott 's use is n't known , and Marriott officials could n't be reached for comment . Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender . Many analysts question %% management %% 's credibility . `` The stock , in my opinion , is going to go lower , not only because of disappointing earnings but { because } the credibility gap is certainly not closing , '' says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth . Mr. Carver says that at a recent Dain-sponsored conference in New York , he asked Michael 's chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down .
management.n | 1 | She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit . Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises , supporters wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today . `` There 's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher 's style of %% management %% has become a political liability , '' says Bill Martin , senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew . The prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community . Last week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up : Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters , the adviser , announced his resignation within an hour .
management.n | 2 | Three years later , machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire . Once again the company 's future looked less than rosy . But after restructuring under new %% management %% , the profits began rolling in . A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks . They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad .
management.n | 2 | Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' chairman , said he had n't yet seen the filing and could n't comment . DPC made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable . Dataproducts had sought a buyer for several months , but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and %% management %% says the company is no longer for sale .
management.n | 1 | Late Thursday , the Treasury said it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week . Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management bills . Instead , the Treasury announced it would sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash %% management %% bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today , as usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday . By moving the settlement date ahead , the Treasury can raise money under the $ 2.87 trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow , after which it reverts to $ 2.8 trillion . The market also was hurt by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru , a Japanese brokerage firm , was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased .
management.n | 2 | However , in light of the risks involved in such transactions , banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions , he said . In other comments , he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy . `` A similar result could sometimes be achieved , at less cost , by changing %% managements %% , '' he said .
management.n | 2 | CMS ENERGY Corp. said %% management %% would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year . The Dearborn , Mich. , energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant . In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .

Among previously disclosed possible bidders is Bloomingdale 's Chairman Marvin Traub , who has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group . Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a %% management %% committee headed by Bloomingdale 's Mr. Traub .

management.n | 1 | Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired . Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money %% management %% unit 's contributions in recent years . In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million . Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
management.n | 2 | The %% management %% turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago . Mr. LaBonte 's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok . The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
management.n | 1 | The acquisition was completed in September . In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed .

Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest . Qintex Australia paid the %% management %% company A$ 32.6 million in the latest fiscal year . Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services . Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia , who must approve payments to the senior executives , balked at the amount .
management.n | 1 | Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the %% management %% contract . Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr .
management.n | 1 | N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed .

Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding IT PAYS to follow a %% management %% career path -- even at law firms . That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant . Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years .
management.n | 1 | Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years . A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of the SEC 's division of investment %% management %% . So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules .
management.n | 2 | When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy %% management %% consultants . `` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
management.n | 2 | If the whole story were told , it would read something like this : -- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made . -- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings ( and %% management %% bonuses ) ; the price , a sea of bad loans . -- For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits . -- The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans ( the Brady Plan ) .
management.n | 2 | The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL %% management %% . British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier . The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
management.n | 1 | `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study . `` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' While utilization %% management %% frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts . The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow . `` The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has been the main focus , '' the panel said .
management.n | 2 | UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase . Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake . UAL %% management %% was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake . The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing . Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
management.n | 2 | Firms Walk Fine Line In Distributing Profits ARE CORPORATE profits distributed fairly ? A survey by Sirota , Alper & Pfau , a New York consulting firm , underscores the difficulty for top %% management %% in satisfying employees and investors on that score .

management.n | 2 | The price can be expected to erode further , because the loss estimate came after the market closed . Commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the U.S. , where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that Commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts . Commodore has assembled an experienced %% management %% team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign . But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones . In the meantime , the strategies will increase expenses .
management.n | 2 | Prospect Group Inc. , whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. failed for lack of financing , apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway . As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an `` amiable agreement , '' Prospect Group will wind up with control of top %% management %% posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment . In a management restructuring , Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman , chief executive and a director , while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director . Mr. Sheinberg remains as executive vice president .

management.n | 1 | Opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts . They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt , a bad trade all around . They believe microeconomics , which addresses the problems of markets , investment climate and %% management %% practices , is the key to developing-country growth , not the IMF 's Keynesian focus on trade deficits , quarterly targets and government debt . They point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive IMF programs . Decisions on increases in the IMF 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by Congress .

management.n | 2 | To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . '' None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater %% management %% equity participation . Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer .
move.n | 2 | In years past , the ad industry 's most distinguished executives did n't hesitate to excorciate Mr. Achenbaum . They have since mellowed , although one senior Young & Rubicam executive , echoing others , said : `` I think ad agencies owe Carl { Spielvogel } a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . '' But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd %% move %% for Backer Spielvogel , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi . Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including Nissan , Toyota , Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan . At Backer Spielvogel , he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies ; aside from agency compensation issues , he helped Nissan , for example , come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line .
move.n | 2 | The venture would be the latest in Coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment . So far this year , it has put nearly $ 700 million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France . The %% move %% also reflects Coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific Basin countries . Aside from Europe , the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come . That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine .
move.n | 2 | Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith . The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 . Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' %% moves %% could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined . In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities . Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .
move.n | 2 | It includes removing $ 242 million in good will from the books , issuing $ 150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $ 52 million in convertible bonds . During the third quarter , the company charged about $ 46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill , added $ 20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $ 30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio . The company said its junk-bond portfolio after these %% moves %% had been reduced to less than 1 % of assets .
move.n | 2 | The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans . The appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans , not just short-term improved financial status . In Dallas , LTV said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the %% move %% will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings . The company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency . But LTV , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed .
move.n | 2 | A state judge postponed a decision on a %% move %% by holders of Telerate Inc. to block the tender offer of Dow Jones & Co. for the 33 % of Telerate it does n't already own .

He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer .
move.n | 2 | Thousands of East Germans attended public rallies organized by the Communist leadership and demanded free speech , controls on the security forces and an end to official privileges . The gatherings in East Berlin and elsewhere were viewed as part of a government effort to stop activists from staging protests to press their demands . Dissidents in Czechoslovakia said the nation 's pro-democracy movement was growing despite the government 's %% move %% to crush a protest Saturday in Prague 's Wenceslas Square . More than 10,000 demonstrators had called for free elections and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes . Police detained more than 350 people .

In the end his %% move %% was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan 's autobiography in The American Economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal .

The FCC %% moves %% were good news for AT&T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation . Alfred Sikes , the new FCC chairman , championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency . But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .
move.n | 1 | Unless , of course , it happens to be run by the Rothschilds . After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall . Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its %% move %% as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992 . Yet the Rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision . In 1796 , Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century .
move.n | 2 | As reported , PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have been Japanese . Yesterday , PaineWebber declined comment . When it owns stocks , Renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell %% moves %% , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades . The broker winning the business does n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price . That puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market .
move.n | 2 | Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C. ) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years . `` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee . The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) and Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy %% moves %% immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed . In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy . `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .

The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring %% moves %% . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .

move.n | 3 | After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly . Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on %% move %% 16 . `` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans . By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap .
move.n | 3 | And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move . Now , after only a dozen %% moves %% , spectators were looking for a mating combination . On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .

But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level . He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency %% move %% .

move.n | 2 | Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the %% move %% is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover . Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
move.n | 2 | Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit . Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' %% move %% for me . Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing . And the Second Law , unique to insurance ?
move.n | 2 | Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months . `` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting %% move %% wo n't result in even greater earnings growth . `` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
move.n | 2 | BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related %% move %% , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals . BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange .
move.n | 2 | Baxter International Inc. , citing cost-cutting %% moves %% and increased sales of its home-care products and dialysis treatments , posted a 20 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 5.9 % sales boost .

move.n | 2 | In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early %% move %% essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently . `` I did n't expect it to be this quiet . I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling , '' said Raymond F. DeVoe , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker , Baltimore .
move.n | 2 | In a %% move %% to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American , New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange . The decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday 's earthquake . The SEC , faced with a major squeeze on options positions , said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow .
move.n | 2 | South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $ 8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding , said Chris Stals , governor of the Reserve Bank and the country 's chief debt negotiator . The new agreement will last for 3 1\/2 years starting July 1 , 1990 , when the current agreement expires . The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur , where proposals for renewed sanctions against South Africa , including %% moves %% to block settling of a new debt agreement , were scheduled to be discussed . As with the previous pact , the new agreement covers the country 's debt `` inside the net , '' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector .

move.n | 2 | Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL , parent of United Airlines , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit . Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . The lightning %% moves %% show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues . The industrial average closed down 18.65 , to 2638.73 .
move.n | 2 | Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence . In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates , the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system . But the Fed %% move %% was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline about one-quarter percentage point .
move.n | 2 | The syndicate , led by Schroders Asia Ltd. , agreed last November to provide the loan to Asia Development Corp. , a U.S. property developer . But several weeks ago , in the wake of the Beijing killings , the loan was canceled , according to bankers and executives close to the project . Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the %% move %% . Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4 , but the harsh crackdown , which caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions , `` gave the banks the out they wanted , '' says an official close to the Shanghai venture . The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June 4 .
need.v | 1 | It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop . Their report galvanized other molecular biologists . `` It was the confirming evidence we all %% needed %% that { gene } losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City . But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy . They focused on chromosome 17 .
need.v | 1 | Advertisers already are balking at higher prices . `` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam . `` If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs , they 're likely to lose all but a few who %% need %% sports , above all . '' Viewers may not be cheering , either . Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials .
need.v | 1 | Jack Kuehler , IBM 's president , said IBM is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific . IBM , which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work , has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips . While IBM , Armonk , N.Y. , makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses , it does n't make the equipment %% needed %% to produce those chips . And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy . Failure of U.S. equipment makers , IBM fears , would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market .
need.v | 1 | The hulk of Stalinism , it seems , will not quickly crumble away . State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them . Polish agriculture will %% need %% a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed . The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here . Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started .
need.v | 1 | Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions . Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt . It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't %% need %% brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states .
need.v | 1 | Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' They %% needed %% new crises to generate new grants and contracts . In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
need.v | 1 | In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than %% needed %% . Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office . He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
need.v | 2 | The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust . The trust , which owns 80 % of Manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims . When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will %% need %% to convert its Manville stock to cash . But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
need.v | 1 | While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House . `` I think { Mr. Phillips } is going to need some help . I think they %% need %% creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co . Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year . `` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
need.v | 2 | The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals . Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building . `` We %% need %% to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman . About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 .
need.v | 1 | `` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm . `` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . '' They are obviously also more susceptible when they %% need %% money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses . `` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive . Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .

Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . They %% need %% only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . '' The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
need.v | 1 | Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea . The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country 's leader . A White House spokesman said that while Bush would n't alter a longstanding ban on such involvement , `` there 's a clarification %% needed %% '' on its interpretation . India 's Gandhi called for parliamentary elections next month . The balloting , considered a test for the prime minister and the ruling Congress ( I ) Party , comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption .
need.v | 1 | Its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself . It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse . He %% needs %% existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion . And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself . He must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .
need.v | 1 | And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we can not regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is %% needed %% , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we can not regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs . We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .
need.v | 2 | The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky . The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they %% needed %% to say no more . The things left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows . Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images .

negotiate.v | 1 | Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel , the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50 % foreign ownership . U.S. companies account for less than 8 % of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987 . But some U.S. companies are %% negotiating %% projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched . Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures . Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .

Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the U.S. , are still more common in Japan than PCs . In the U.S. , one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of %% network %% . In Japan , about 1 % are linked . `` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says Roger J.

Now , the giant marketing company , which holds 25 % of Japan 's 4.4 trillion yen ( $ 30.96 billion ) advertising industry , is considering the acquisition of an advertising %% network %% in the U.S. or Europe . What is driving Dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe . `` If we do n't do something ... we wo n't be able to catch up with demand , '' says a Dentsu spokesman .

Time officials declined to comment . Last week , Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $ 225 million for a 50 % stake in its Showtime subsidiary , which is a distant second to Time 's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV %% networks %% to cable subscribers . Tele-Communications , the U.S. 's largest cable company , said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment .

The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a %% network %% for simultaneous processing . But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .

While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the %% network %% was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake . `` I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster , '' said Mr. Premner . `` So before I start to be really critical of NBC , I would like to know more about what happened .

At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails . But U.S. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah , the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories , which the U.S. does n't classify as terrorism .

With regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ? A number of considerations suggest that this %% occurs %% early in the process . Change involves the displacement of form . This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .

order.n | 6 | First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares , up from 886 million shares Thursday . An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday . Dealers placed heavy buy %% orders %% in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions . But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors , who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week , the Wako official said . Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's `` abnormal fever '' in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares .
order.n | 6 | Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity . Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an %% order %% for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
order.n | 6 | `` The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term . '' September orders for all U.S. producers , in fact , were slightly above the monthly average for 1988 , a good year for the industry . `` Aerospace %% orders %% are very good , '' Mr. Cole says . `` And export business is still good . While some automotive programs have been delayed , they have n't been canceled . ''
order.n | 6 | The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3 % , the same as in August . Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index . All orders-related components , such as consumer-goods %% orders %% and building permits , are thought to have been weaker . Data Resources ' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales . Usually , October `` is n't a very interesting month { for retail figures } because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents , '' he said .
order.n | 6 | Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer %% orders %% are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
order.n | 2 | Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the %% order %% of 1 % or 2 % a year . The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .

order.n | 6 | Exchange officials extended trading hours , 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday , to clear up order backlogs . In France , more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks -- including such giants as BSN and Elf Aquitaine -- did n't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day , traders say . The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy %% orders %% , solving an order-imbalance problem . But by that time , many big institutions had switched business to London . `` Belgium was closed for two days , France closed for a couple of hours , Germany was stuck .
order.n | 6 | But James Ireland , a Miami-based technical analyst with Avmark Inc. , an aircraft evaluation firm , estimated the total `` half-life '' value of the 15 planes at about $ 650 million or more . Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell , beginning in 1992 , have a current half-life value of about $ 34 million each , or a total $ 374 million , raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ 1.02 billion . Mr. Ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong , partly because surging %% orders %% for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists . He predicted that PWA would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers . Under its revised fleet plan , PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year .

order.n | 6 | National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost %% orders %% following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .
order.n | 6 | Britain 's current account deficit dropped to # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.56 billion ) in September from an adjusted # 2 billion ( $ 3.21 billion ) the previous month , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year . The Confederation of British Industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown , largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to 15 % . `` The outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with %% orders %% and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said David Wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee . He also said investment by businesses is falling off . Of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28 % plan to spend more .
order.n | 1 | The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law . The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week . They discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court %% orders %% seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial . But David Runkel , chief Justice Department spokesman , said the guidelines `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . '' Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
order.n | 1 | The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases . A related editorial appears today . Under { RICO } , the government may seek a temporary restraining %% order %% ( TRO ) upon the filing of a RICO indictment , in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered . Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants , including clients , vendors , banks , investors , creditors , dependents , and others . Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process .
order.n | 6 | That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York . She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the %% orders %% total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
order.n | 6 | Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping . Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first time in 2 1\/2 years in August . In July unfilled %% orders %% grew 1 % . But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row . `` It means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going .
order.n | 6 | A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall . That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . Analysts say they think durable goods %% orders %% fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . The stock market 's decline , coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout .
order.n | 6 | They scooped up hundreds of S&P futures when the market needed it most . At about 10:40 a.m. EDT , several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks . `` It is very clear that those buy %% orders %% came from people who wanted their franchise protected , '' said one Chicago-based futures trader . `` These guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are . '' Traders said Goldman Sachs , Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment .
order.n | 6 | Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders . More stop-loss %% orders %% were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year . She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range .

order.n | 1 | CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup . The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point . `` The interpretation '' of the executive %% order %% , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . '' In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA . The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
order.n | 6 | The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half . The June killings magnified the problems . In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no %% orders %% in June . At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months . `` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says .
order.n | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under %% orders %% to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .
order.n | 6 | There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing . So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges . Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of %% order %% . And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions .
order.n | 6 | A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . Limit Order : Limit %% orders %% are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
order.n | 6 | Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' %% orders %% because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
order.n | 6 | The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit %% orders %% turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
order.n | 6 | If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled . Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled . But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the %% order %% because the investment has passed the specified price . Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
order.n | 6 | Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the %% order %% is automatically canceled . Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says .
order.n | 6 | It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting . Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other %% order %% . In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security . Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
order.n | 6 | For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . `` Day %% orders %% '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .
order.n | 6 | The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss %% orders %% under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
order.n | 4 | His steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney . `` We have the structure , people and plan , '' Mr. Isler said in a statement . Now , the first %% order %% of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $ 3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a Cup challenge . The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull . In September , a New York appellate court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team .
order.n | 6 | Panic frequently results in irrational behavior . And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe . When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell %% orders %% at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
order.n | 1 | In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new %% order %% has n't arrived without resistance . Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations . Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners .
order.n | 6 | The order is the biggest in the company 's history . Sales in the latest period edged up to $ 295.7 million from $ 293.9 million . Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in %% orders %% `` puts us well on the way to our goal of $ 1.6 billion in bookings for the year . '' He added : `` I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year . '' Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year .
order.n | 6 | Workers could dial out , but they could n't receive telephone calls . `` It 's a very uncertain situation right now , '' said Navin Vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily volume of about 10 million shares . Because the exchange 's computer was rerouting %% orders %% to the exchange 's trading operations in Los Angeles , `` business is as usual '' Mr. Vyas said . `` If one city is down , the other can take over . '' Meanwhile , the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying to cope .
order.n | 6 | Japanese machinery makers received orders totaling 1.465 trillion yen ( $ 10.33 billion ) in August , up 14 % from a year earlier , the Economic Planning Agency said . `` Equipment %% orders %% on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and power utilities , '' said an agency official . The latest report compares with a modest 9.9 % increase in July machinery orders from a year earlier .
order.n | 6 | The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer . Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988 . The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain %% orders %% in cooperation with another trader , David Stein . The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years . Also , he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $ 35,000 to a customer .
order.n | 6 | Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m . As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders . Many funds allow investors to void %% orders %% before the close of trading . At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches . Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put .
order.n | 6 | While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations . Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer %% orders %% . The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration .
part.n | 1 | It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan . The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract . The clause was %% part %% of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise . Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern , some Machinists union supervisors received a 20 % pay raise . The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them .

Borden even tested a milk with 4 % butterfat in the South , but decided the market was too small . Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and %% parts %% of New Jersey . And it 's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says Greg Ricca , sales director at La Lecheria . Because of Leche Fresca 's success , he says , the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes .

Mr. Green thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback . `` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or %% part %% of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. Green said the judge asked him . Appalled , Mr. Green never paid the money , he testified . But he did n't complain to the state 's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board , either , saying later that he feared retribution .
part.n | 1 | `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains . That 's because the male %% part %% , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile plants .
part.n | 1 | This , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written . My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission , the Environmental Protection Agency , Friends of the Earth , etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited . When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study , I was urged to get back to the agenda topic , which was , ironically , a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs , the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important %% part %% of the CFC substitution scenario . Subsequently , I have learned that a private group , of which Du Pont is a part , is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments . But this is almost an underground activity .

Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year . The company attributed the decrease in %% part %% to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts . U.K. sales for last year 's quarter were about $ 3 million .
part.n | 1 | More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act . This week , a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce 's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses : the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects . The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only %% part %% of the problem -- and a part that 's gone . `` If HUD is to be reformed , '' it concluded , Members of Congress will `` have to start looking into , and doing something about , the practices of their colleagues . '' Of course , self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in .
part.n | 1 | Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff , president of its CBS Records unit , said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement . Wayne Smith , an attorney at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony , said the Sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time . '' Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't %% part %% of the negotiations between Sony and the duo . Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up . But Mr. Smith said Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio .
part.n | 1 | Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding , which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion . It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration 's approval for a new drug , and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $ 30 million to $ 70 million . The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as %% part %% of its $ 8 million contraceptive program . But the Population Council , a 37-year-old , $ 20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives , has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer , Roussel-Uclaf , a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government . In the year since the pill went on the French market , the National Organization for Women and its offshoot , former NOW President Eleanor Smeal 's Fund for a Feminist Majority , have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .

Mr. Guber , in his affidavit , says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 , Mr. Semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company . '' Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988 , when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy %% part %% of MGM\/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio . Mr. Guber says he had crossed out `` MGM '' with a red pen and written in `` Columbia , '' giving the document to Mr. Semel . `` Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing to indicate Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia , '' Mr. Guber says .
part.n | 1 | The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December . The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers . The sale , which had been expected , is %% part %% of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February . Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit . That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .

part.n | 1 | Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old . Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . Most of the land in that and other %% parts %% of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .

The introductions also mark Texas Instruments ' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years . Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines it has introduced since the first %% part %% of the decade have been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability .

part.n | 1 | The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 . The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets . However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important %% parts %% of the system it sets out to preserve . The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated . These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .

part.n | 1 | I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell 's exchange with a Gosbank representative ( `` Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails , '' editorial page , Oct. 5 ) with great interest , since the gold standard is one of my areas of research . Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union 's large gold reserves would give it `` great power to establish credibility . '' During the latter %% part %% of the 19th century , Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100 % of its outstanding currency , but no one outside Russia used rubles . The Bank of England , on the other hand , had gold reserves that averaged about 30 % of its outstanding currency , and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world . The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets , and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain .

part.n | 1 | Indeed , Mr. Corry , at an August press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . '' However , shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas : Having two major products would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings . As Mr. Roderick once said : `` We 're a two-product company and , boy , if you ca n't figure out the value of those two %% parts %% , you are so damn dumb that you do n't belong on Wall Street .

The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other . Ms. Bogart 's cast is %% part %% and parcel of the problem . Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna .

part.n | 2 | Still , analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term . `` The impact wo n't be that great , '' said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp . That is in %% part %% because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding , she said . In addition , Mrs. Lidgerwood said , Norfolk is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income . Longer term , however , the buy-back is expected to increase earnings , especially after 1990 , Mrs. Lidgerwood said .

part.n | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As %% part %% of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .

They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore . Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known %% part %% of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere . Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper . Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .
part.n | 2 | Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their %% part %% , are satisfied with the police response they receive . Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses . But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .

Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important %% part %% of Cathay 's strategy . But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .

part.n | 1 | Personal space ( Figure 3 ) has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day . The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms ( Figure 4 ) has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for my record collection , whose worth , I think it 's safe to say , is incalculable . Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been %% part %% of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market ( Figure 6 ) , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .

The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered %% part %% of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .

As %% part %% of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face value of debt . However , that figure could be revised , Financial Corp. said . Currently , the company has about six million common shares outstanding .
part.n | 1 | The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . As %% part %% of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor ( D. , Ark . ) calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . To be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill .

As %% part %% of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash . Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .

part.n | 1 | In 1900 , for instance , less than 8 % of assets went into bank deposits . That rose to nearly 18 % during the Depression , and has n't changed much since . Pension reserves , on the other hand , made up a relatively small %% part %% of household assets until the last decade , when they skyrocketed . And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms . That 's some of what emerges from the following charts , which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years .

part.n | 1 | A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland . Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most %% parts %% of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .
part.n | 1 | Since commercial air travel is interrupted , Aetna , based in Hartford , Conn. , chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area . About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon , along with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks . Some adjusters , already in other %% parts %% of California , drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers . Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims . State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , the largest home and auto insurer in California , believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ 475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo .

part.n | 1 | During the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return . The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal . Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as %% part %% of its anti-takeover restructuring . But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment .

But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors . The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was %% part %% of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals . The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court . `` I think it 's fairly clear { Mr. Keating } knew , '' that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said .

Scot MacInnis , a masseur in Boulder , Colo. , had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as %% part %% of a store promotion . Three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red . Paramedics were called .
part.n | 1 | A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers %% part %% of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial `` take-or-pay '' contracts . The court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use . FERC 's regulation had given pipelines until March 31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short .
part.n | 1 | The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` Metamorphosis , '' another multiple work . %% Parts %% 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris 's acclaimed film , `` The Thin Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name . When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film . Served up as a solo , however , the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium .

people.n | 1 | Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio . The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business . But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and %% people %% familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week . Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions . But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .
people.n | 1 | The figure excludes a record number employed by extraordinary government work programs , the Labor Directorate announced Tuesday . Including those in the state programs , there were 143,800 Norwegians , or about 6.5 % of the work force , without permanent employment in October , up from September 's 136,800 . The number of %% people %% registered as jobless at the end of October declined by 900 from September to 78,600 . Those employed in state-funded special programs increased by 7,400 to 65,200 in the same period , the Directorate said . In October 1988 , there were 40,800 fewer employed by government programs .
people.n | 1 | Indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry . Still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares . `` The primary overriding thing is that %% people %% are frightened , '' says Martin Sass , a New York money manager . `` The aftershocks of Oct. 13 ( when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points ) are still reverberating . '' Certainly , the Oct. 13 sell-off did n't settle any stomachs .
people.n | 1 | Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait . A bomb exploded at a leftist union hall in San Salvador , killing at least eight %% people %% and injuring about 30 others , including two Americans , authorities said . The blast , which wrecked the opposition labor group 's offices , was the latest in a series of attacks in El Salvador 's 10-year-old civil war . Hungary 's Parliament voted to hold a national referendum on an election to fill the new post of president .
people.n | 1 | Pinkerton 's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business , with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired , he adds . And regional offices were `` egregiously overstaffed , '' he claims . One office had 19 %% people %% doing the work of three , `` and half of the employees had company automobiles . '' American Brands declined to comment on Mr. Wathen 's accusations . The acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company , Pinkerton 's , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , California Plant Protection , with $ 250 million in sales , creating the industry 's biggest firm , which took on the Pinkerton 's name .
people.n | 1 | They have about seven candidates . Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . There is evidence that if %% people %% inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects . He theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
people.n | 1 | Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. . And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice . `` We have too many %% people %% in our home offices , '' says Yoshio Hatakeyama , the president of the Japan Management Association . `` Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low . '' With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners .

When it comes to busting ghosts , the Monroe , Conn. , couple are perfect demons . They claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country .
people.n | 1 | It is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout . The fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey found . Fewer %% people %% said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics . Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise . That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
people.n | 1 | `` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year , '' says Krys Spain , research specialist for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . `` It 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully . %% People %% are too embarrassed to say they have n't done anything . '' While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she says the percentage of Americans who do `` real exercise to build the heart '' is only 10 % to 20 % . So many people fudge on answers about exercise , the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : It must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60 % of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes .
people.n | 1 | Nursing Home Patients Apt to Be Private Payers FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare . State governments place very low ceilings on how much property %% people %% may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills . Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance . But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10 % -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged .
people.n | 2 | Wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among `` la-la activists . '' Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American %% people %% these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth .
people.n | 1 | The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management . `` The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways , '' Mr. Westendorf concludes . `` First , we have better quality assurance than ever , because the %% people %% building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work . Second , we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product . '' At Grumman 's Aircraft Systems Division , a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract .
people.n | 1 | One thing 's for sure : There have been a ton of them , and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest . Gerald Ford , a fairly down-to-earth fellow , once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that `` there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon . I think we owe it to the American %% people %% to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject . '' Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise : `` If I become president , I 'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public , and the scientists . I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one ... . ''
people.n | 1 | The only consensus is that more money and people may leave Hong Kong than had been thought likely . This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy 's prospects . The question , as many %% people %% see it , is how long such uncertainty will last . Maureen Fraser , an economist with W.I. Carr , a subsidiary of France 's Banque Indosuez , believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 . It may experience an upswing or two in between .
people.n | 1 | By ignoring costs , U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions . That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers . These %% people %% have different agendas . And as a result -- as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney 's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense `` strategy . '' How can we turn this situation around ?
people.n | 1 | Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral . Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves . The %% people %% of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students . Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians . Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance .
people.n | 1 | `` We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance , '' Mr. Thompson says . `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance %% people %% to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York exchanges have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges .
people.n | 1 | In Mr. Luzon 's first year , the bank eliminated 800 jobs . Now it says it 'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years . The bank employs 8,000 %% people %% in Spain and 2,000 abroad . To strengthen its capital base , Banco Exterior this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors . The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches .
people.n | 1 | So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about . I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem . The efforts to get to the %% people %% who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important . But , I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work . The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs .
people.n | 1 | Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Oct. 14 from 396,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . The number of %% people %% receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.1 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2 % . Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
people.n | 1 | The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s , before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry 's deregulation in 1986 . `` People come to us saying they 'd like to be back where they were a few years ago , in a more collegial atmosphere , with less tension , '' says Stephen Waterhouse , managing director of Hanover Partners Ltd. , a financial district head-hunting firm . But after trading losses in the mid-October market jolts here , many %% people %% will be lucky to have jobs at all , executives predict . The industry , which currently employs about 25,000 people in London , has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years . `` I can see cuts of at least 20 % more , '' says the head of the London office of a major U.S. firm .
people.n | 1 | But in 1989 most senators have other ideas . Last July , his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama . Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get %% people %% hurt , a charming notion for a great power . Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban . So the administration dropped it .
people.n | 1 | Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins 's support among Jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points . In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty . `` A lot of %% people %% think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says . `` I am aware we have real budgetary problems . '' The city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair .
people.n | 1 | -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect . The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President Roh . But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary %% people %% to buy a home . Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .
people.n | 1 | He 's rich , famous and intelligent , and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do . Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless , speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind . Personally , I 'm glad there are %% people %% like him around to slow down the profit takers , and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future , not caring about the long-range implications . Ron Dyer
people.n | 1 | To argue that this is `` not likely '' to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense . A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation , and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation . Does the Journal really believe that %% people %% ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1 % or 2 % a year .
people.n | 1 | ( There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . ) What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines . It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its %% people %% and in its island geography . As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children . As a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school .
people.n | 1 | Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high . Last year , the tourists left $ 3 billion with the area 's casinos , nearly 10 % more than in 1987 . The %% people %% with a stake in Nevada 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade . `` If you build a better mousetrap , it will catch more mice , '' says Fred Benninger , chairman of MGM Grand . Ellen Cokely , a tourist from Alton , Ill. , seems inclined to agree .
people.n | 1 | Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed . They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly . Ms. Bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or %% people %% . Kelly\/Varnell had put South Gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room , or about 100 humans overall . This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist 's own digs : `` My loft was 50 by 100 feet , so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room . ''
people.n | 1 | This is not the case . Some diaries simply are n't worth snooping in . Yet there will be %% people %% who will sob at `` Immediate Family , '' a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption . These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles , no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told . Written by Barbara Benedek , co-author of `` The Big Chill , '' `` Immediate Family '' takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children .
people.n | 1 | Indeed , it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information . '' Now , scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation . And of course they agree that %% people %% can impose restrictions on the use of their papers , whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries . But in the `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act . And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials , copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points .
people.n | 2 | `` The president does n't want to have legislative sanctions , '' says a U.S. official . `` But he may not have a choice . '' Given China 's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own %% people %% , Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions . Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations . Sentences have been stiff .
people.n | 1 | HEALTH CLUBS gear up for a graying clientele . Although their ads picture curvy young %% people %% in skimpy outfits , club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set . `` It 's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged , '' says Michael Pacholik , sales manager of the LA Fitness club , Diamond Bar , Calif . About 10 % to 15 % of members at Atlanta 's Holiday Espre Center are elderly , says Gerald Williams , fitness consultant .
people.n | 1 | A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone . With its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings , `` it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching , '' says Mr. Appel . `` But we were getting too many complaints that %% people %% were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors .

people.n | 1 | To some mothers , the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been . `` My first reaction is I do n't understand why it 's taken so long . Why has it taken %% people %% so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem ? '' asked Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion . Similar sentiments were voiced on Capitol Hill . `` While I 'm pleased the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children , it 's taken much too long to get to this point , '' said Rep. Ted Weiss .

Peter Gebhard , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the %% people %% to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30 % this year to $ 100,000 . Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president .
people.n | 1 | No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority , but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts . Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences . `` In the past , %% people %% who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said . `` Now you go to districts , you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' Two hundred years ago , critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests .
people.n | 1 | But less than two years later , the LDP started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights . The symptoms all point to one thing : Japan does not have a modern government . Its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120 million %% people %% in the back seat . In a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice . It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world .
people.n | 2 | The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese %% people %% , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .
people.n | 1 | At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several %% people %% familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state .
people.n | 1 | Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured . %% People %% who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .

people.n | 1 | `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 %% people %% in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables .
people.n | 1 | After the legislature confirmed him as the Communist Party leader , Krenz said demonstrations to demand democratic freedoms could cause a `` worsening of the situation , or confrontation . '' He also reaffirmed East Germany 's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy . But as many as 12,000 %% people %% marched in East Berlin after the speech to protest his election . During the balloting , 26 members of the 500-seat Parliament voted against Krenz , a move considered unprecedented in the country 's 40-year history . Officials in East Berlin , responding to complaints from opposition groups , admitted police used excessive force in dispersing protesters this month .
people.n | 1 | As for junk-holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR . The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar , according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York , which trades distressed securities . %% People %% who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders say that 's not enough .
people.n | 1 | But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job . `` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says James Mogan , 45 , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk . The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four %% people %% . `` My style is less informal , '' Mr. Brawer says . Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership .

people.n | 1 | Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards , Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $ 3 billion annually . The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures , behind West Germany , Finland and Italy . According to several %% people %% present at the meeting , Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S. , possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush . Judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products . Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste , a commodity in chronically short supply here .

The White House said Bush is conferring with leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to ease differences over guidelines for CIA agents .
people.n | 1 | The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school . The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away . Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 %% people %% had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise . The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said . The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts .
people.n | 1 | It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , %% people %% close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .

people.n | 1 | Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including East Bay residents making a long detour . `` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official . About 23,000 %% people %% typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours . About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
people.n | 1 | On lampposts along Fillmore Street , a major Marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake . The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals . The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some %% people %% have sought temporary homes for birds and fish . For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat . `` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA .
people.n | 2 | In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government . Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort . There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban %% people %% . Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
people.n | 2 | Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill . The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American %% people %% , states and local governments . Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s . In fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief .
people.n | 1 | As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for %% people %% aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
people.n | 1 | What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ? Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ? Because in the end , these %% people %% always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? '' There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them . `` These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms .
people.n | 1 | `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . `` %% People %% honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy .
people.n | 1 | Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and %% people %% whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
people.n | 1 | The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . `` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . `` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich %% people %% . '' No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish .
people.n | 1 | Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . '' He declines to go into specifics . Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which %% people %% generally are more prone to sue . `` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he says . Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore .
people.n | 1 | `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture %% people %% about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
people.n | 1 | But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . '' However , several %% people %% said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .

'' We can applaud Mr. Pryor 's moment of epiphany , even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again .
people.n | 1 | The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an `` act of God . '' For now , says Laurence Drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association , `` the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued , or whether they have liability or not . We still have %% people %% wandering around in a daze in San Francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight . '' But that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering . In San Francisco , they argue , an earthquake was a near certainty .
people.n | 1 | Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many %% people %% and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages .
people.n | 1 | `` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent . `` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . '' Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many %% people %% in Hollywood the wrong way .

I think some %% people %% may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says . Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls . Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
people.n | 1 | I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . '' I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them . Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into %% people %% 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat . `` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction .

'' Polls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter . Unless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month .
people.n | 1 | Your Sept. 27 page-one article `` Charleston Lost Quite a Lot to Hugo , Especially Gentility '' leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience . The damage reported focused on a select few who owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery . Not mentioned were the 50,000 %% people %% rendered homeless , and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period ; the $ 1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands ; the near - and long-term impact on the state 's largest industry , tourism , not to mention the human suffering . In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities , your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city . The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country .

Especially galling for Mr. Steinhardt , say %% people %% close to him , is that USAir 's Mr. Colodny wo n't even take his telephone calls . While USAir is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in August of a 12 % stake in the company to Mr. Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway , are pretty strong . USAir 's deal with Mr. Buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' Mr. Steinhardt says .
people.n | 1 | A disaster-contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco 's aid was n't needed , he adds . Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion . The telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of %% people %% seeking to make a call at the same time .

Turkey has been fighting its past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another %% people %% ? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis .

A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors . The United spokesman said none of its %% people %% were injured at the airport ; in fact , as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night , two babies were born . Yesterday , the United ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends . The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
people.n | 1 | Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . That 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export . `` %% People %% are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem , '' said Mr. Robertson . In addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness . Since March , exports have been virtually flat .
people.n | 2 | Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker : Both spent years overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend , the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens . More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo . Faced with another Mr. Honecker , so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German %% peoples %% will get their reunification , de facto , on West German ground . But if East Germany 's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental . Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall .

In Oakland , hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway . At least 270 %% people %% were reported killed and 1,400 injured in the rush-hour tremor that caused billions of dollars of damage along 100 miles of the San Andreas fault .

'' Overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . `` %% People %% were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a Citicorp spokesman said . But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . Ronald I.

people.n | 1 | The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of %% people %% between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % .
people.n | 1 | There are some important caveats : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say . Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living . %% People %% also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . `` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. Blankenship , a Del Mar , Calif. financial planner .

plant.n | 2 | Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . The researchers said they have isolated a %% plant %% gene that prevents the production of pollen . The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself . Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed .
plant.n | 2 | That 's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant . In a labor-intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile . They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male-sterile %% plants %% . The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants . The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies .
plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .
plant.n | 2 | In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co . One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant 's pollen . But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging %% plants %% ' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans , animals and beneficial insects . However , Paul Johanson , Monsanto 's director of plant sciences , said the company 's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is `` gentle on the female organ . '' Biosource Genetics Corp. , Vacaville , Calif. , is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen .

The government also urged whites to refrain from panic over growing black protests , such as the massive anti-apartheid rally Sunday on the outskirts of Soweto . Researchers in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid %% plants %% for a number of crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . The scientists at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. isolated a gene that could lead to a generation of plants possessing a high-production trait .

Chrysler has had to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there . At Chrysler 's 1990 model preview last month , Chrysler Motors President Robert A. Lutz said the No. 3 auto maker , along with other U.S. manufacturers , might be forced to `` realign ... capacity '' if market demand does n't improve .
plant.n | 1 | The West German machinery and %% plant %% equipment industry 's orders rose an inflation-adjusted 1 % in September from a year earlier despite a sharp drop in foreign orders , the German Association of Machinery Makers said . Before adjustment for inflation , the association said , orders were up a nominal 5 % . While domestic orders climbed an adjusted 8 % and a nominal 11 % in September , foreign orders declined 4 % after inflation and 1 % on a nominal basis .
plant.n | 1 | `` Westinghouse 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , '' says Russell L. Leavitt , of Salomon Brothers Inc . The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade . Already this year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt %% plants %% from Intercontinental Energy Corp. , among others . Westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing . In the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power plants it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals .
plant.n | 1 | Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity . Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear %% plant %% in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
plant.n | 1 | The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products . Eli Lilly & Co. , the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer , dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin . Lilly is building %% plants %% to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein , France . In its latest annual report , Lilly said Humulin sales have shown `` excellent growth . '' Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin , but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths .

The Dutch utility firm serves the Amsterdam and Utrecht areas . The planned turbogenerator %% plant %% is expected to go into operation in 1994 .
plant.n | 1 | ( Reliance floated a $ 357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was , at the time , the largest public issue in Indian history . ) The media has raised questions about Larsen & Toubro 's issue , pointing out that it exceeds the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization . Even stranger is the case of Usha Rectifier , a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $ 28 million that 's raising $ 270 million to build an iron %% plant %% . Once the money is raised , it is n't always certain how it is used . Larsen & Toubro , for example , says it 's raising $ 570 million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs .
plant.n | 1 | The company has five other U.S. plants , including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100 , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year . General Mills , meanwhile , finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity . A large %% plant %% in Covington , Ga. , is to come on line next year . A Kellogg officer , who asked not to be named , said the Memphis project was `` pulled in for a reconsideration of costs , '' an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction . Initial cost estimates for the plant , which was to have been built in phases , ranged from $ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion .
plant.n | 1 | General Motors Corp. said it will temporarily idle its Arlington , Texas , assembly plant for one week beginning Monday because of slow sales . The closing will affect about 3,000 workers and eliminate production of 700 cars . The assembly %% plant %% builds the Cadillac DeVille , Chevrolet Caprice and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Wagon . In addition , GM 's Truck & Bus Group said slow sales are forcing it to close its Detroit assembly plant the week beginning Monday . The plant builds chassis for recreational vehicles and about 450 workers will be affected by the closing .
plant.n | 2 | Calgene Inc. and Gustafson Inc. said they plan a joint project to develop biological products to control such %% plant %% diseases as aflatoxin , a potent cancer-causing agent . Under the plan , the companies will use Calgene 's patented technology to encapsulate microbes such as Bacillus subtilis , a bacterium , to enhance their biological activity against plant diseases . Calgene , an agricultural biotechnology concern , said initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of Bacillus subtilis which has shown promise for controlling aflatoxin .
plant.n | 2 | South Gardens , as the Bartlett scheme is called , will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan . It could cost taxpayers $ 15 million to install and BPC residents $ 1 million a year to maintain . Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of %% plants %% and gardens , South Gardens , as now planned , will die from congestive garden design . Ms. Bartlett 's previous work , which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world , often took gardens as its nominal subject . Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb .
plant.n | 2 | Lynden B. Miller , the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park 's Conservatory Garden , recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street 's Bryant Park : `` Bryant Park , as designed in 1933 , failed as a public space , because it made people feel trapped . By removing the hedges and some walls , the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up . It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and %% plants %% . '' The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . '' They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places .
plant.n | 1 | Hoechst AG 's Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995 . In April , Hoechst , the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany , said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50 % by 1993 . Mr. Hilger said Hoechst will invest 50 million marks ( $ 27.2 million ) in a %% plant %% to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated . The company hopes the new plant , likely to be built in Frankfurt , will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year . This year , Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt , Spain and Brazil .
plant.n | 1 | McDonald 's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988 . But Goodyear said total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2 % . Total tire segment sales were up only about 1 % to $ 2.2 billion , and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire %% plants %% because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers . In the latest quarter , Goodyear 's tax rate was 51 % compared with 41 % a year earlier . As a result , total tax outlays were $ 73.5 million , compared with $ 44.1 million the year earlier .
plant.n | 1 | Because most businesses put market share above profitability , to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat . The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd. , Japan 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners . Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another %% plant %% , which will lift its production capacity 50 % . The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to 30 % from 27 % currently . Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , `` are all adding production lines , '' a Daikin spokesman says .
plant.n | 1 | Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say . In the past five years , USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several %% plants %% and reducing labor costs . But the short-term outlook is so-so . It is n't surprising that Messrs. Roderick and Corry view steel so differently .
plant.n | 1 | Grain , milk and meat come next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast . Poland makes no machinery for a %% plant %% on that scale . Solidarity wants it from the West . Maria Stolzman , one of its farm experts , lays it on the line : `` The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system . ''
plant.n | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will build a $ 24 million power %% plant %% to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
plant.n | 1 | Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman said . The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses . The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly %% plant %% at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 . About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down . Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations .
plant.n | 1 | Detrex Corp. said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio %% plant %% reduced its third-quarter net income by $ 1.9 million . Detrex , which has annual sales of about $ 100 million , declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter . The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 . The plastics %% plant %% is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast . The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area . The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo .
plant.n | 1 | The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants . So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old %% plants %% . The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology . The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles .
plant.n | 1 | For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield %% plant %% for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
plant.n | 1 | In the quarterly report , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , New York Times Co. chairman and chief executive officer , said negative factors affecting third-quarter earnings will continue . Analysts agreed with company expectations that operating profit will be down this year and in 1990 . Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing %% plant %% in Edison , N.J. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs . `` With the Edison plant coming on line next summer , the Times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future , '' said Peter Appert , an analyst with C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell . `` But many newspapers are facing similar comparisons . ''
plant.n | 1 | Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines . Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration %% plants %% east of the Mississippi River . Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . `` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said .
plant.n | 1 | The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community . Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ( $ 157.8 million ) in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs . In addition , the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion on tooling up their %% plants %% . Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles . By pooling their resources , the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed , he said .
plant.n | 1 | Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant for the first time since April 1986 . About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23 , and overtime has been eliminated at the %% plant %% for the fourth quarter , a Chrysler spokesman said . That 's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations . Sales of Cherokee , the best-selling Jeep , and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10 % through the end of last month .
plant.n | 1 | Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected . General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October . GM said the assembly %% plant %% , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
plant.n | 1 | AT&T unveiled a sweetened early retirement plan for management that the company hopes will save it $ 450 million in the next year . Also , profit rose 19 % in the third quarter . Chrysler will idle a Toledo assembly %% plant %% temporarily due to slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles . Digital Equipment 's profit fell 32 % in the latest quarter , prompting forecasts of weaker results ahead . Analysts were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders at the computer maker .
plant.n | 1 | It is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter . Typical , perhaps , was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. , the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont , about 35 miles south of Oakland . Ten of the %% plant %% 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized . Metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says . The plant was evacuated and workers sent home .
plant.n | 1 | In addition , some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday 's . Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor . Intel said that over the past decade , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its %% plants %% . Like other large Valley companies , Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation , so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch . That 's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp. , Houston , which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
plant.n | 1 | Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed . Trading on little specific information , market players overnight in Tokyo began bidding up oil prices . The rally spread into European markets , where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the San Francisco area 's large oil refining %% plants %% . By yesterday morning , much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone . West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets .

plant.n | 1 | The commission , which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February , said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition . The French chemical giant would hold an 80 % share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin . The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger , Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates %% plant %% Monsanto operates in Wales , removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction .
plant.n | 1 | `` They 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible . '' No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers , who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators . Nucor 's plant in Crawfordsville , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket , and it will be years before such %% plants %% can compete in the high-profit market . Still , flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter , representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year . Moreover , the process is n't without its headaches .
plant.n | 1 | SsangYong , which has only about 3 % of the domestic market , will sell about 18,000 of its models this year , twice as many as last year . It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year . The company plans to expand %% plant %% capacity 50 % by 1991 . By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 . Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit .

Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance . Agreement on these %% points %% is a long way from a specific program , and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system . But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine . `` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is , '' says Mr. Seidman , who heads the AFL-CIO 's department dealing with health matters .

'' He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage %% point %% a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter . He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement . Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .

point.n | 14 | Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading . Big Board officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . Even though the Big Board says its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's Friday the 13th market plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 %% points %% it did . With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders say . `` If we had the baskets , we would be leaving in caskets , '' one trader said .

Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year . The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage %% point %% in the latest week to 7.85 % . Long-term CDs declined just a fraction .

point.n | 14 | By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down . When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday . Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 %% points %% on the day . Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar . They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed .

point.n | 14 | Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage %% points %% statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
point.n | 14 | In response , Treasury prices soared 1 1\/8 points , or about $ 11.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount . But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery . The industrial average ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 %% points %% . Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building .

Under the rules adopted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase futures . At this %% point %% , the Dow industrials were down 75.41 points and falling . The trading halt in the S&P 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many traders maintain . But as the fright began to spread through the S&P pit , the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively .
point.n | 14 | But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market . The industrial average closed down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 . Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150 a share , triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 %% points %% in the final hour of trading . UAL stock closed at $ 170 a share , down $ 8.375 . Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding .

Exxon has made them before , at which %% point %% the state demonstrated they were untrue . The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim .

point.n | 14 | `` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said Joel Marver , chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group . `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said .

point.n | 5 | London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . Fund selling also picked up at that %% point %% . According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts . This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling .
point.n | 14 | `` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . '' He seems to be typical of many professional money managers . When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage %% point %% more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . On Friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .

The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets . A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 %% point %% drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another . Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out . The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation .

point.n | 14 | The stock-market rally was led by blue-chip issues , but , unlike Monday 's rebound , was broadly based . Indeed , over-the-counter stocks , led by technology issues , outleaped the industrial average . The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52 , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 , its highest one-day jump in %% points %% this year .

point.n | 14 | That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street . But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . `` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis %% points %% ( 0.25 percentage point ) becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant . `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .

Energy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs . The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 %% points %% last Friday . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 . Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall .

The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products .

First National Bank of Boston , for example , is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage %% point %% on six-month and 12-month CDs . Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week . New York 's Citibank , for instance , increased the yield on small-denomination three-month CDs to 8 % from 7.9 % .
point.n | 14 | Why is the stock market suddenly so volatile ? Yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance : It plunged 60.25 %% points %% before lunch , with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes .

point.n | 14 | But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors . Some so-called high-quality junk issues , such as R.H. Macy & Co.

The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking %% points %% in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters . In 1986 , India signed a $ 1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , to purchase 400 artillery pieces .

The S&P 500 futures contract , which moves in fractions of an index %% point %% under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . Each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held .

point.n | 4 | In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama . The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega . The Command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act 's six points , Cap Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson 's 14 %% points %% necessary to justify U.S. support . So far no one has . The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 .
policy.n | 1 | A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) , who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush 's handling of the Soviet relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting . But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of %% policy %% . '' Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers . `` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. Bush said .
policy.n | 1 | It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems ( `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone %% Policy %% ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 ) . To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted . Consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure .
policy.n | 2 | In another development yesterday , creditors were told that $ 40 million they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize , according to one source . Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $ 20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market , the person said . And plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance %% policy %% have hit a snag , the source said . An Eastern spokesman said `` the $ 40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern 's plan . Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant . ''
policy.n | 1 | Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled . Factory payrolls and production fell in September , and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch . But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen %% policy %% , partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing . In addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . Inflation may be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5 % .
policy.n | 1 | There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad . After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting %% policy %% on covert activities . If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years . Over the past week , the president has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
policy.n | 1 | To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary %% policy %% . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .

At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir Alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a %% policy %% Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS . Faced with a similar situation , Paul Volcker let the dollar soar , ( though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation ) .
policy.n | 1 | As far as the pound goes , some traders say a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week . While the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts say it is in critical condition . Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a %% policy %% squabble with other cabinet members . He was succeeded by John Major , who Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation . But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound , currency analysts contend .
policy.n | 1 | MEDICINE SHOPPE INTERNATIONAL Inc. declared a 3-for-2 stock split , and substantially boosted the dividend payout . The franchiser of pharmacies said the added shares will be distributed Dec. 4 to stock of record Nov. 13 . The company also changed its dividend %% policy %% , under which holders had received an annual 10 cents-a-share payment , by declaring a four-cents-a-share dividend , to be paid quarterly on post-split shares .
policy.n | 1 | Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn . Moreover , state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say . The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government %% policy %% . In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard . At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation .
policy.n | 1 | The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key 2.90-mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks late Wednesday . Mr. Lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Indeed , only hours earlier , Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson 's economic %% policies %% `` sound '' and said she has `` always supported '' him . `` There was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst , '' said Patrick Foley , deputy chief economic adviser for Lloyds Bank in London . `` The resignation came as a great surprise . ''
policy.n | 2 | Mr. Hammack is eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house , which has to come down . `` When will I get that check for a million dollars ? '' he jokes . The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations , but says : `` We 're talking %% policy %% limits . '' In this case , that 's about $ 250,000 . It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos , an affluent community in Santa Clara County , may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay .
policy.n | 1 | When President Bush travels to Costa Rica today , he 'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels . But the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's %% policies %% in Central America . Some conservatives say Mr. Bush should n't make the trip , during which he will participate in Costa Rica 's celebration of 100 years of democracy . These critics object to Mr. Bush 's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests .
policy.n | 1 | But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 . After that , it will make a final decision on the %% policy %% . The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start-up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture-capital firm . With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
policy.n | 1 | Mr. Greenspan said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal ( D. , N.C. ) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years . `` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal 's monetary policy subcommittee . The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. Lee Hamilton ( D. , Ind. ) and Byron Dorgan ( D. , N.D. ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary %% policy %% moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed . In responding to questions , Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy . `` What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said .
policy.n | 1 | The dollar is still highly volatile . The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly , but whether the main reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the Friday 13 market drop , only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know . Earlier this year , Martin Feldstein , president of the National Bureau of Economic Research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic %% policies %% . Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level , he said , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . '' The more we think about it , the more we suspect Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .
policy.n | 1 | Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including Communication Control System Ltd. , which owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one-party law . But vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used . Radio Shack says it has a %% policy %% against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . He says he has n't yet studied the Dellums bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . ''
policy.n | 1 | California 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications . Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa . He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define %% policies %% and strategies of the group . '' Farmers was quick yesterday to point out the many negative aspects it sees in having Axa as its parent . For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses .
policy.n | 1 | The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies ( such as bonds ) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction . 2 . In seeking approval of a TRO , the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties , balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets . 3 . In deciding whether forfeiture ( and , hence , a TRO ) is appropriate , the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; the government 's %% policy %% is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime . 4 . When a RICO TRO is being sought , the prosecutor is required , at the earliest appropriate time , to state publicly that the government 's request for a TRO , and eventual forfeiture , is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is , in requesting the TRO , the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant ; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them ; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties ; and will , in all other respects , assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected , through proceeding under { RICO } and otherwise . The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO .
policy.n | 1 | But some legislators think the time may be ripe to revise the constitution . THE IRS WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges . %% Policy %% statement P-5-39 sets out terms . As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges . If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error .
policy.n | 1 | Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates . In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' `` I am convinced that a monetary %% policy %% for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said . The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % . Bush administration officials say inflation is under control .
policy.n | 1 | What are the facts on this type of lending ? The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching %% policy %% reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's .
policy.n | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO %% policy %% is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
policy.n | 2 | ( Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . ) Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say . Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard %% policies %% as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage . Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
policy.n | 1 | Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed . At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating . Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit %% policy %% stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy .
policy.n | 1 | He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of %% policies %% to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
policy.n | 2 | Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish . Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . Besides term life and whole life ( the old standbys ) , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , %% policies %% with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on . What to do ? First , generalize .
policy.n | 2 | Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older . So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : %% policies %% structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
policy.n | 2 | And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this . So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment . The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life %% policy %% . You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years . One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life ( you pay for the whole policy at once ) , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
policy.n | 2 | But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes . And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate %% policy %% that provides it . I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life . Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
policy.n | 1 | Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions . At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel %% policies %% . The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ''
policy.n | 1 | Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises . Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary %% policy %% to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . '' Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary . And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .
policy.n | 1 | This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national %% policy %% making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff . An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) .
policy.n | 1 | Two new Remics totaling $ 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday . Foreign Bonds British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic %% policy %% address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson . The Treasury 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 29\/32 to yield 10.09 % , while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\/32 to yield 12.94 % . In Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
policy.n | 1 | The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience . There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years : 1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary %% policy %% could yield a net improvement in employment and output . 2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it . Despite all the formal provisions for its independence , the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it .
policy.n | 1 | `` I do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest '' at stake . But Mr. Skinner disagreed , calling the legislation `` a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry . '' In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson ( D. , Calif. ) , the secretary also said the bill `` would be at odds with the administration 's %% policies %% welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources . '' Currently , the Transportation Department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance . However , if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate , the department may revoke its certificate , grounding the airline .
policy.n | 1 | But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . President Bush told reporters : `` Whether that { the leadership change } reflects a change in East-West relations , I do n't think so . Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the %% policies %% of Honecker . '' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
policy.n | 2 | In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer , Travelers Cos. , the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country . Travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies . They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit ; thus , such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the %% policies %% , the insurers say . The appeals court disagreed on both counts . Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant .
policy.n | 1 | Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed 's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary , the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget . The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . Fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary %% policy %% . Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed . '' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
policy.n | 1 | The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further . It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1\/4 percentage point to about 8 3\/4 % from its previous target level of about 9 % . The rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in Fed %% policy %% . It ended at about 8 11\/16 % yesterday , but was as low as 8 1\/2 % Monday . The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\/2 point , or over $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since Thursday .

A week later , the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . `` It was a powerful point in my career , '' says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis , who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability %% policy %% for his business . `` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage . The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her .

In other stock-market news , the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that for the week ended Friday , the balance of margin buying rose 189.8 billion yen ( $ 1.34 billion ) , to 7.160 trillion yen ( $ 50.46 billion ) . The balance of short %% positions %% outstanding fell 159.7 billion yen , to 779.8 billion yen . In London , prices finished at intraday peaks , comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its `` golden share '' in auto maker Jaguar . But trading was very sketchy , as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks .
position.n | 2 | After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats . Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and %% positions %% with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year . The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus . Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance .
position.n | 2 | Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . '' Yesterday , Joel Zweibel , an attorney for Eastern 's creditors committee , declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to . He said only that the committee has not yet taken any %% position %% on Eastern 's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating . `` In every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said . Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size .
position.n | 5 | Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional %% position %% . And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
position.n | 2 | Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your %% position %% that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ? The Moloch that knows no God but more ? ''

'' The move , which could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 42.5 million ) in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. Maier said . All 700 Toronto-based employees will be offered %% positions %% in Calgary , the company said . The company will save between C$ 4 million and C$ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to Calgary , Mr. Maier added . Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .
position.n | 2 | Scenario 1 , known as the `` Constant Dollar Freeze , '' reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4 % per year . This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985 , and it reduces the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994 . Scenario 3 , the `` Current Dollar Freeze , '' has been the approximate %% position %% of the House of Representatives for about four years . It freezes the budget at its current level , and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 . This reduces the baseline by $ 229 billion .
position.n | 4 | `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said . But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session . That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial %% positions %% of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
position.n | 3 | CAMBREX Corp. , Bayonne , N.J. , declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share , payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10 . The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding . The company said the move recognizes its strong financial %% position %% . Although profits were `` squeezed '' in 1989 , mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs , the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond . In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $ 13 a share .
position.n | 4 | But a few funds have taken other defensive steps . Some have raised their cash positions to record levels . High cash %% positions %% help buffer a fund when the market falls . Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year , says John Frabotta , portfolio co-manager . He says the fund , which is 40 % leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds .

Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's %% position %% on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention . He 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .

Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been president since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the %% position %% to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units . `` It certainly was n't intended to be a demotion , '' the spokesman said .
position.n | 5 | He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit . Mr. Roy could n't be reached . Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo , a new %% position %% . Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo 's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit . Mr. Nadeau said he intends to remain Provigo 's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold , after a which a new chief executive will be named .
position.n | 3 | Prosecutors wanted $ 23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ 400,000 . The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank . Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges `` which the company is not in a %% position %% to dispute '' because of RICO . Part of Drexel 's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose . So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what , if anything , Drexel did wrong .
position.n | 4 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short %% position %% change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 ( see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 ) .
position.n | 3 | Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it . Consistently , D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form . When most spectators thought its %% position %% hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down . Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision . While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
position.n | 4 | They might even step up sales in a falling market , he said , in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries . Technically , Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level . When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their %% positions %% . Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders .
position.n | 4 | The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 . London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their %% positions %% and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . Fund selling also picked up at that point . According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
position.n | 3 | General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong %% positions %% in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
position.n | 3 | At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its %% position %% as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' The Qintex Australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing . He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
position.n | 4 | Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated . By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today . `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI %% positions %% , Mr. Selkin said . Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . Philip Morris added 1 1\/8 to 44 1\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3\/8 to 70 3\/8 , Merck gained 1 3\/8 to 77 3\/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7\/8 to 43 3\/8 on 2.5 million shares .
position.n | 3 | Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale . The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining %% position %% with the board . However , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
position.n | 3 | Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach , Calif. , thrift . Mercury , which has assets of more than $ 2 billion and 24 branches in California , said the action to improve its regulatory capital %% position %% is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation . Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco . Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ 4.875 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
position.n | 5 | Marginal operations and assets have been sold . The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage %% positions %% have been eliminated . Even perks have been reduced . For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
position.n | 2 | Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 . You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls . My %% position %% is one founded on both the facts and the law . Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling ( and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative ) . The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .

position.n | 6 | Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership %% position %% in the coffee business . But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers . `` Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .
position.n | 5 | Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line . `` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says George Palmatier , a Minden , Nev. , sales consultant and author of `` The Marketing Edge . '' Still , says John Sullivan , a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston , who has held senior sales %% positions %% at Polaroid and Atari : `` The customer will react to strength . Ignore the present condition . Show it 's business as usual . ''
position.n | 4 | An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar lower Tuesday , but profit-taking on short %% positions %% helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts . While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows . Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen .
position.n | 3 | Ratings under review are Ryder 's A-1 collateral trust debentures , A-2 senior notes and bonds , A-2 preferred stock and the company 's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper . Moody 's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets . The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs , improve margins and enhance its competitive %% position %% in its primary business , vehicle leasing and rental .
position.n | 5 | SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc . Thomas E. Meador , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co. , a Skokie , Ill. , subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm . Balcor , which has interests in real estate , said the %% position %% is newly created . Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor . In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management .
position.n | 4 | As the stock market bounced back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday , when investors dumped $ 2.3 billion , or about 2 % of stock-fund assets . Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , said phone volume was more than double its typical level , but still half that of Oct. 19 , 1987 . Net outflows from Fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ 300 million , or below 15 % of the $ 2 billion cash %% position %% of the firm 's stock portfolios . Much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds . Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago , Fidelity said .
power.n | 1 | In 1983 , Texas Air 's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy . Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy . `` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample %% power %% to block undesirable deals .
power.n | 1 | Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership . We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform . This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the %% power %% of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries . Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home . The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation .
power.n | 1 | If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal %% power %% , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika . Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform . But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
power.n | 3 | The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire , their regular-season leader with 33 , and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt . `` Think I 'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove , '' quipped the big first baseman Saturday night , fingering the gold bat he wears on a neck chain . Even with that %% power %% show , though , the Oakland Series ' star , certified by the Most Valuable Player award , was a pitcher , Dave Stewart . He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One , and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake . Stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds .
power.n | 3 | Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear %% power %% plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
power.n | 3 | ABB Asea Brown Boveri B.V. said it signed a contract for the largest-ever power plant order in the Netherlands . ABB said the contract , signed with the Dutch utility N.V . Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA , is valued in excess of $ 200 million . The accord is for a turbogenerator plant at the coal-fired %% power %% station Hemweg in Amsterdam . ABB Asea Brown Boveri is the Dutch unit of the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG . ABB said a significant portion of the order will be placed with Dutch subcontractors , adding that a group has been set up for this purpose .
power.n | 1 | `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' In addition to giving a president %% powers %% to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
power.n | 1 | It lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses . They , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares . The Fed also has the %% power %% to set margin requirements . But would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly ? Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole .
power.n | 1 | The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992 , including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders , cooperatives and joint ventures . Some forms of private property would be sanctioned . Such moves would greatly reduce the %% power %% of government ministries , who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform . -- FINANCES . Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis , notably its $ 200 billion budget deficit .
power.n | 1 | Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop . Article I , Section 7 , Clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything else , Presidents must have the chance to veto . Labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca n't deprive the President of his %% power %% to veto items . Finding a test case should n't be hard , but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible . The White House had the perfect case , but Congress blinked before it could go to court .
power.n | 3 | The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides %% power %% to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
power.n | 1 | Nicholas Brady , the incumbent treasury secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does n't like it much . Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea . That may have pleased the secretary , but H. Erich Heinemann , chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg , Thalmann & Co. , suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the %% power %% he needs . Like most treasury secretaries , Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course . He was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury .
power.n | 3 | Robert L. Wood , 37-year-old chief financial officer , was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent %% power %% producer , succeeding Raymond L. Hixson , 63 . Mr. Hixson , who resigned effective Jan. 1 for health reasons , remains a director .
power.n | 3 | In addition to owning HBO , with 22 million subscribers , Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers . Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers , and Viacom has about one million . In its suit against Time , Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market %% power %% . Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications , Viacom has potentially more power , particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV , VH-1 and Nick at Nite . Ironically , Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business .
power.n | 3 | Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear %% power %% plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .
power.n | 1 | The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving %% power %% to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .
power.n | 3 | More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . In contrast , dashboard computers , %% power %% seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days . GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option .
power.n | 3 | AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for %% power %% semiconductors in January . The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field . AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
power.n | 3 | But Conner is n't standing still . Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
power.n | 3 | Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing %% power %% of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . Risk is also a function of time . When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
power.n | 1 | When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve ( buy and sell orders at various prices ) be made available to all , not just to market makers . Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . To add aftershock-damping %% power %% to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena ( and the information that would automatically accompany such access ) by investors -- particularly institutional investors . Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
power.n | 1 | The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical . The Fed is responsive to , and can not help being responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government . The Fed exercises a %% power %% given to it by Congress and the president . But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed . Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic .
power.n | 3 | The transactions are unrelated . The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V . Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for %% power %% generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill . That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp . Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
power.n | 3 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out %% power %% lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
power.n | 3 | When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air . Michael L. Bandler , vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co. , says nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . The battery packs have enough %% power %% for only three hours , but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell 's network , only four went down . One of those was in Hollister , Calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter .
power.n | 3 | `` I 'm happy and sad , '' he said . Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view . Having argued that Galileo 's plutonium %% power %% source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday , they were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch . Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992 , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter . The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then .
power.n | 1 | Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation . The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the %% power %% to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low .
power.n | 3 | The concern 's National Service Division opened a center for emergency service in Walnut Creek as part of its disaster-recovery plan . KAISER ALUMINUM & CHEMICAL , Oakland , metal and chemical maker , annual sales of $ 2.22 billion , had slight structural damage to its 28-story headquarters building and employees stayed home yesterday to allow crews to clean up . LOCKHEED CORP. , Calabasas , aerospace and defense concern , annual sales of $ 10.59 billion , NYSE , said its Lockheed Missiles & Space division closed its Santa Cruz test facility because of %% power %% outages and landslides . The closing , affecting 266 employees , will continue at least until roads are cleared . It was n't known to what extent , if any , the facility was damaged .
power.n | 1 | It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought . Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts . Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial %% power %% to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers . That 's the conventional theory anyway . In practice , however , the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur .
power.n | 1 | In the previous three general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote . In 1971 , the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war . In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in %% power %% , she was restored to office . Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts , the Congress ( I ) will lose big . But if the opposition remains fractured , the Congress ( I ) could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government .
power.n | 1 | It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain %% power %% . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .
prepare.v | 2 | EAST GERMANS RALLIED in three cities to demand democratic freedoms . As the country 's new leader , Egon Krenz , %% prepared %% to travel to Moscow today for talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev , hundreds of thousands of East Germans massed in the streets of Leipzig , Halle and Schwerin to call for internal freedoms and the legalization of the New Forum opposition group . Krenz , however , vowed to preserve the Communist Party 's hold on political power and said East Germans should n't destabilize the nation with unrealistic demands . Communist officials this month have faced nearly daily pro-democracy protests , accompanied by the flight to the West by thousands of East Germans .
prepare.v | 2 | Video Telecom Corp. , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television . The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines . And it is %% preparing %% to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network . While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper . An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .
prepare.v | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
prepare.v | 1 | Mr. Gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to Stikeman , Elliott , one of Canada 's biggest law firms , is advising Pepper Hamilton 's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment , corporate finance and international transactions . QUOTABLE : In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
prepare.v | 1 | Schopenhauer never learned Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer . Two things contribute to his popularity . First , Carl respects his audience and %% prepares %% his speeches carefully . Even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes . He has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations : `` humility '' will be `` humly '' , `` with '' will be `` w '' , and `` that '' will be `` tt '' .
prepare.v | 1 | At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity . No , Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived . When he had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to %% prepare %% tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds . Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn . Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless .
prepare.v | 1 | The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible . Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors . The cooks had %% prepared %% one of the best meals we 'd had in a long time , and on Montero 's orders had baked enough bread to last the day . Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered . The worst part had been the waiting ; ; although we did n't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group , which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market . Clients include Miller Brewing Co. and General Motors . Mr. Mingo was hospitalized Sept. 23 and died Monday , according to Samuel J. Chisholm , the agency 's %% president %% and chief operating officer . Ad Notes ... . EARNINGS :
president.n | 1 | But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble . The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge . Atsushi Muramatsu , Nissan 's executive vice %% president %% for finance , helped set the tone in December 1986 , when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery . `` This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said . Yutaka Kume , who took the helm as Nissan 's president in June 1985 , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . ''
president.n | 1 | To increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc. 's Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc. , maker of Anne Klein jewelry , are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies . They 're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels , and they 're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase . `` We 've started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores , '' says Kim Renk , a Swank vice %% president %% . But there are limits . Ms. Renk says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs .
president.n | 1 | He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania . And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983 , the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him `` one of the best available , '' after interviewing local lawyers . `` He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former %% president %% of Cambria County 's 150-member bar association , who , like most lawyers in Cambria County , refuses to talk about the judge publicly . `` He 's sharp as a tack . He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc. , another company controlled by Mr. Hollander . A company spokesman did n't know Mr. Wakeman 's age . James R. Lees , 51 , vice %% president %% of Newport 's European operations , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations , assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes . Arthur B. Crozier , 34 , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John Virtue , who was another of the ousted directors .
president.n | 1 | Thomas A. Donovan , 37 years old , formerly vice president , West Coast operations , at this hazardous-waste-site remediation concern , was named executive vice %% president %% and chief operating officer , both newly created posts , and a director , filling a vacancy . Canonie said it anticipates naming Mr. Donovan to succeed Richard F. Brissette , 55 , as president and chief executive officer , effective March 1 . Mr. Brissette will remain a Canonie board member and will be a consultant to the company .
president.n | 1 | Raymond E. Ross , 53 years old , formerly group vice president , U.S. plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern , was named senior vice %% president %% , industrial systems , succeeding David A. Entrekin , who resigned Monday .
president.n | 1 | John Franco , 47 years old , formerly vice chairman of Capital Holding Corp. and %% president %% of its Accumulation Investment Group , was named chief executive officer of this insurance holding company , effective Dec. 1 , succeeding Robert T. Shaw , who remains chairman . I.C.H. also named Steven B. Bing , 42 , senior vice president since 1986 , as president , succeeding John W. Gardiner , who will join the HMS Acquisition Corp. division of Hicks , Muse & Co. , which has agreed to buy most of I.C.H. 's Denver-based subsidiaries .
president.n | 1 | In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries . The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales . But as Bill Austin , Giant 's %% president %% , puts it , `` With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength , the game has changed .
president.n | 3 | BUSH AND GORBACHEV WILL HOLD two days of informal talks next month . The %% president %% said that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda . A simultaneous announcement was made in Moscow . Bush said that neither he nor Gorbachev expected any `` substantial decisions or agreements . ''
president.n | 1 | At a time when most analysts and industry consultants say pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive , adding capacity and debt could squeeze Georgia-Pacific if the industry declines more than the company expects . Moreover , any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa 's major product lines -- containerboard , which is used to make shipping boxes , and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities . `` Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be , '' said Rod Young , vice %% president %% of Resource Information Systems Inc. , a Bedford , Mass. , economic-forecasting firm . `` Depending on how far down you go , it may be difficult to pay off that debt . '' One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company 's debt of almost $ 3 billion .
president.n | 1 | The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger . Mercury also is shrinking itself , part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly . Such a focus is `` more profitable , more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control , '' said William A. Shane , Mercury 's senior executive vice %% president %% . As of Sept. 30 , Mercury 's assets were $ 2.25 billion , down from $ 2.62 billion a year ago . For the nine months , Mercury posted a loss of $ 5.4 million , or 86 cents share , against net income of $ 4 million , or 63 cents share , a year earlier .
president.n | 1 | Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is . Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts . Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers . Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year . Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
president.n | 1 | Quotron Systems Inc. plans to cut about 400 , or 16 % , of its 2,500 employees over the next several months . `` This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line '' with revenue , said J. David Hann , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron . The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a `` response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry , which has been contracting '' since October 1987 's stock market crash , the executive added . Quotron , which Citicorp purchased in 1986 , provides price quotations for securities , particularly stocks .
president.n | 3 | The dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold . Capital flight is reported to be strong . The big question is whether the new %% president %% will have the strength and the political support in Congress to take steps to cure Brazil 's economic ills . President Jose Sarney , who took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation . The unpopular Mr. Sarney , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule , is n't seeking re-election .
president.n | 3 | After years of mistrust born of Watergate , past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Iran-Contra scandal , President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now , at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities . If that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years . Over the past week , the %% president %% has agreed to keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing . That was n't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters . Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so .
president.n | 1 | `` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . '' BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . William O. McCoy , %% president %% of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter . Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable . For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
president.n | 1 | Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization . That means Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock . Jim Unruh , Unisys 's %% president %% , said he is approaching next year with caution . He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards . He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .
president.n | 1 | The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better . Y&R 's Klein Steps Down Arthur Klein , %% president %% of Young & Rubicam 's New York office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven , Conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 . In an internal memo , Alex Kroll , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense . `` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R , '' Mr. Kroll wrote .
president.n | 1 | ( Jacksonville , Fla. ) -- Charles Bates , president , chief executive and chief operating officer will resign from these positions and the board effective Oct. 31 . Norman J. Harrison , chairman , will succeed him as chief executive . Roger L. Sutton , executive vice %% president %% , was appointed as the new president and chief operating officer . Kerry P. Charlet will become executive vice president , and retain his positions as chief financial officer and treasurer .
president.n | 1 | Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , %% president %% of Bear Stearns Cos . Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility .
president.n | 1 | Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo , chairman and chief executive of Continental 's parent , Texas Air Corp . Mr. Lorenzo , 49 years old , is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. Corr signed on . The airline also named Mickey Foret as %% president %% . Mr. Foret , 44 , is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines , its predecessor . Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air .
president.n | 1 | The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C$ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year . Revenue was C$ 291.6 million , up from C$ 252 million in 1988 . Martin Fabi , Innopac 's %% president %% and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move . `` I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , '' he said . Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .
president.n | 1 | Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange . Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board . '' Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice %% president %% since March 1988 . He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel . By contrast , the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider , Arnold F. Staloff , as its president .
president.n | 1 | This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by Milton B. Hollander , whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford , Conn. acquired most of its 49.4 % stake in Newport in August . Elected as directors were Mr. Hollander , Frederick Ezekiel , Frederick Ross , Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier . Removed from office were George Pratt , Robert E. Davis , Norman Gray , John Virtue , corporate secretary , and Barrett B. Weekes , chairman , %% president %% and chief executive officer . Newport officials did n't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier , Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board .
president.n | 1 | The head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots . In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News , Ron Tonkin , %% president %% of the National Car Dealers Association , says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable . Mr. Tonkin , who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . '' U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September , according to Ward 's Automotive Reports .
president.n | 3 | More provocatively , some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution . They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I , Section 7 , of the Constitution that states : `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him or ... disapproved by him ... . '' This clause , they argue , is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the %% president %% can veto a `` bill , '' and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , for one , accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush `` to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional . '' There 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved .
president.n | 3 | Indeed , although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto , some , ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed . Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic %% president %% again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . ''
president.n | 1 | But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice %% president %% of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco . `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive . Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
president.n | 3 | Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation . Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a %% president %% as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power . But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock .
president.n | 1 | He made a special trip to examine U.S. environmental trends because they are often followed in Europe . ENI needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $ 1.3 billion on upgrading its refineries , he says . Oil companies world-wide will have `` to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required , '' says John H. Lichtblau , the %% president %% of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way service stations pump fuel into cars . In the U.S. , the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves .
president.n | 1 | Carl E. Pissocra , %% president %% and chief executive officer of Bank One , Dover , has been named regional president , a new post at the bank-holding company . Mr. Pissocra , 56 years old , will be responsible for the company 's 10 banks in the Eastern region . Dan J. Hartwell , 41 , executive vice president of Bank One , Dover , was named president and chief executive of the Dover bank , succeeding Mr. Pissocra .
president.n | 1 | Mark Q. Huggins was named executive vice %% president %% and chief financial officer . Mr. Huggins , 39 years old , formerly was controller and chief accounting officer at Harte-Hanks Communications Inc . Management Co. manages entertainers and produces , markets and finances entertainment .
president.n | 3 | According to Mr. Nixon 's office , `` This is solely a fact-finding trip . There will be no sightseeing , no shopping and no social events . '' Mr. Nixon 's office said the former %% president %% `` expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders '' and will give his assessment of those leaders to President Bush upon his return . A poll conducted in 12 of 16 NATO countries shows that the Dutch appear to be the strongest supporters of the alliance . The poll , conducted for the Dutch daily De Telegraaf by Gallup International said 81 % of Dutch people supported NATO .
president.n | 1 | Ellen Cokely , a tourist from Alton , Ill. , seems inclined to agree . `` I 'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here , '' says Ms. Cokely , watching seven-year-old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip 's Wet 'n' Wild water park . `` Two generations ago , Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion , '' says Van Heffner , executive vice %% president %% of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association . `` One generation ago , Mom joined Dad . Now , in the '90s , we 're headed toward a total resort environment . ''
president.n | 1 | David Evans , who last week resigned as %% president %% and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. `` for personal reasons '' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection , has been temporarily reappointed to both positions , the company said . Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd , 37 years old , would join the nine-member board . He succeeds Roger Kimmel , who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying MGM\/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary .
president.n | 1 | One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's %% president %% . There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor ( and now the governor of Texas ! ) and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees . `` You stay out of it , '' author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying .
president.n | 3 | Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the `` best '' schools . As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan , does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated , black , working-class woman , Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her ? Or that the %% president %% would have hurried to sign the bill `` out of compassion for her plight '' ? To ask those questions is to answer them . Finally , the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government .
president.n | 3 | ( During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . ) TAX SHELTERS CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts , or `` IRAs , '' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving . That Labor Day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as %% president %% , Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act . Pension reform was its main thrust . Labor and business leaders , quoted at the White House Rose Garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .
president.n | 1 | H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp. , a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $ 17 billion . Mr. Schwarz , 52 years old , will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. 1 , soon after Mr. Davison reaches the company 's mandatory retirement age of 65 . Mr. Schwarz , who is %% president %% of U.S. Trust , will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer , 42 , who is executive vice president in charge of the company 's asset-management group . U.S. Trust , a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S. , has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established , and heavily promoted , private-banking businesses of their own . As a result , U.S. Trust 's earnings have been hurt .
president.n | 3 | And the vacillation did n't end there . Just a month ago , Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life . Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the %% president %% said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest . But only four days after that , Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat . `` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
president.n | 3 | His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office , affirming his `` firm support of our cause '' during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January . He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion . But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July , the %% president %% began to lower the volume . When the ruling was handed down , the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself . He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .
president.n | 1 | The remaining four trustees on the Claimants Trust have 60 days to nominate a successor to Mr. Saltzburg . Judge Merhige will make the appointment . CHICAGO LAW FIRM recruits American Express Co. vice %% president %% : Coffield Ungaretti Harris & Slavin brought in Howard A. Menell as a partner in its Washington , D.C. , office , which opened Oct. 1 . For the past six years , Mr. Menell , 43 years old , served as vice president for government affairs at American Express .
president.n | 1 | The potential bill : more than $ 600 million for several seasons , an 80 % jump . A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than CBS now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise . `` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports %% president %% now at Multimedia Inc . J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . ' And the winners will be the colleges , not either network .
president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Tucker , 44 years old , is president of Trivest Securities Corp. and senior vice president of Trivest Inc. , closely held investment companies based in Miami .

Upchurch Jr. , 37 , vice %% president %% and general counsel , was selected to serve the remainder of the term vacated by John S.P. Samford , who resigned as director .
president.n | 3 | The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote . By comparison , Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement . Only 42 GOP members opposed the %% president %% 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year . At a recent White House meeting , Rep. Silvio Conte ( R. , Mass. ) , the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee , argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto , and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday , they are plainly uncomfortable with his position . `` This is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said Rep. Henry Hyde ( R. , Ill. ) , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement .
president.n | 1 | Orders from Campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration . This is no longer true because of Campeau 's massive debt load . `` It 's all anybody wants to talk about , '' says Richard Posner , executive vice %% president %% for Credit Exchange Inc. , a leading credit service . `` People wonder what 's going to happen next . '' Many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to Campeau stores .
president.n | 1 | Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year . Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly .

president.n | 3 | `` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn . ) of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request . `` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said . The %% president %% 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts .

president.n | 3 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the %% president %% complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
president.n | 3 | The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes . While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as %% president %% and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
president.n | 1 | The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico . Rafael Carrion Jr. , chairman of Banco Popular , will be the chairman of the holding company . Alberto M.

Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million .

president.n | 1 | The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers . American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling . Susumu Ohara , %% president %% of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine . `` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said Thomas Kenney , a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group . `` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft .
president.n | 1 | That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice %% president %% of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
president.n | 1 | Because he sees a `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon . Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills . Greg Confair , %% president %% of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . `` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says .
president.n | 1 | `` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . J. Thomas Allen , %% president %% of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says . But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
president.n | 1 | Jerome Grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high . `` You have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said . Dr. Grossman , who also is %% president %% of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston , noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements .

president.n | 1 | He concedes H&R Block is `` well-entrenched '' and `` a great company , '' but says `` it does n't grow fast enough for us . We 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable { price-earnings } multiple . '' Thomas M. Bloch , %% president %% and chief operating officer , says `` I would disagree '' that the tax business is mature . For example , he says , the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service , tested in parts of the country , aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry . Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through .
president.n | 1 | Because of the size of the California market , few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath . But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state . `` What you 're going to get is ` We do n't want to put all of our eggs in one basket ' theory , '' said James H. Renzas , %% president %% of Location Management Services Inc. , a Palo Alto , Calif. , relocation concern . Mr. Renzas , among others , said the quake will prod companies in certain industries , like semiconductors , computers and aerospace , to consider moving operations that involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California . Because of the quake threat , `` some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere , '' he said .
president.n | 1 | But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup . But `` Friday did n't help things , '' says Mr. Schaefer . With the gyrations of recent days , says Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice %% president %% at Charles Schwab , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . '' Joseph Grano , president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc. , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market . Investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says .
president.n | 1 | `` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . '' Campbell Soup Co. , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands . `` The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 , '' says Tony Adams , the company 's vice %% president %% for marketing research . `` The best odds are with your core franchise .

Glorioso , Digital 's vice %% president %% for high performance systems , says Digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations , personal computers , printers and other devices . And unlike IBM 's water-cooled mainframes , it does n't need any plumbing . The challengers will have a big price advantage .
president.n | 1 | Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or Exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill . Like thousands of salespeople before them , Wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news . `` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said Richard Miller , the Lowell , Mass. , computer concern 's new %% president %% , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over .

president.n | 1 | `` Ford 's appetite to attack { Jaguar } could gradually wane over time , particularly if Saab is a reasonably attractive proposition , '' says John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute . He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to Ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months .

Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies . Sierra Tucson Cos. , a Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week .
president.n | 1 | Expo enthusiasts argue that holding the fair would attract businesses , create jobs and help renovate abandoned sections of town . But opponents fear overcrowding . `` This city already has too many tourists , and it ca n't hold them all , '' says Pierluigi Beggiato , the %% president %% of the Venice hoteliers association . About 40 Italian businesses , including Fiat S.p . A. and Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. , have formed a consortium to lobby for holding the expo in Venice . Three gambling casinos have opened in Poland .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco . And , according to one dealer , Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' Nicholas Hall , the %% president %% of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money . People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter . ''

U.S. and Soviet negotiators opened talks in New York aimed at resolving differences in proposals to reduce chemical-weapons arsenals . While the Kremlin has urged a ban on output of the poison gases , the White House wants to continue %% producing %% the weapons even after an international treaty calling for their destruction is signed . South Africa 's government said peaceful demonstrations such as the anti-apartheid rally Sunday near Soweto have helped ease tensions and assisted political changes . About 70,000 people attended the anti-government rally , at which leaders of the banned African National Congress refused to renounce violence to end apartheid .
produce.v | 2 | NBC 's re-creations are produced by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions , which also makes the successful prime-time NBC Entertainment series `` Unsolved Mysteries . '' The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated nonetheless . News programs , particularly if they score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to %% produce %% than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 for a one-hour program . Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that . Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as `` A Current Affair , '' which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .

'' These days , `` Batibot '' is %% produced %% in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment . It is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks . With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` Batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs .
produce.v | 1 | Boeing Co. said Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $ 450 million . The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly %% produced %% by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France . Currently , Boeing has a backlog of about $ 80 billion , but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists , which entered its 22nd day today . Last week , a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers , who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10 % over three years .
produce.v | 1 | Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , %% producing %% a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .

produce.v | 2 | Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' %% produced %% by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
produce.v | 1 | However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member . Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system . `` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can %% produce %% at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi . At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling . They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
produce.v | 1 | Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy ( Figure 5 ) , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market ( Figure 6 ) , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has %% produced %% an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .
produce.v | 1 | As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely . One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota . Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to %% produce %% results . But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . `` The results were fascinating , '' he said .
produce.v | 1 | In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can %% produce %% previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
produce.v | 1 | These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters ' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott . There is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being %% produced %% around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .
produce.v | 1 | The Leopard 's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it %% produced %% good results ? ? In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked . The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .
produce.v | 1 | One beat poet composes a poem , `` Lines On A Tijuana John '' , which contains a few happy hints for survival . The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity . The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they %% produce %% is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation . Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ? Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .
promise.v | 1 | CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience %% promised %% to advertisers . CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .
promise.v | 1 | In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster . `` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach said . On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush %% promised %% to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts . California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans . The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .

'' The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which %% promised %% investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits .

But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he %% promised %% us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf . ( But who 's counting . ) Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah .

promise.v | 1 | Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space . But Keith looked down more than up . He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he %% promised %% himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords . At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war . But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .
promise.v | 1 | Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Wo n't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil 's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia . I %% promised %% to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice . Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie 's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda 's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles .
propose.v | 1 | The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had %% proposed %% that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years . Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies .

Consumers Power and Bechtel Power Corp. last year announced a joint venture to buy the plant , currently owned completely by the utility .
propose.v | 1 | Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million . Some of the %% proposed %% modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels . Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions .

He had preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he %% proposed %% to do here . He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor . But then , at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose .

Nobody %% proved %% that more masterfully than Mr. Coelho , the former Democratic majority whip . Declaring that there was life after Congress , he resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a 1986 junk-bond investment , before any official investigations took hold . Among the glitterati who turned out in bipartisan black-tie force to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were Sen. Robert Dole , Rep. Newt Gingrich , and other kingpins of Congress .
prove.v | 2 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family %% proved %% profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
prove.v | 1 | But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been %% proved %% inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .
prove.v | 1 | He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably . He treats it with a mythological , universal application . As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be %% proven %% by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families . Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil . Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
prove.v | 1 | A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball . There will be romance and flirtation . If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could %% prove %% to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
prove.v | 2 | He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing %% proved %% to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men 's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
purchase.v | 1 | Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices . `` Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there is n't enough grain in the pipeline , '' said Katharina Zimmer , a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .

Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale . The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD %% purchased %% in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
purchase.v | 1 | First Executive Corp. said about 96 % of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised . Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said . Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also %% purchase %% an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units . First Executive said the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business . In addition , analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding .
purchase.v | 1 | One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to %% purchase %% the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
raise.v | 1 | Transport giant TNT , which owns half of one of the country 's two major domestic carriers , said the cost of the dispute had been heavy , cutting TNT 's profits 70 % to $ 12 million in the three months to Sept. 30 . Brazilian financier Naji Nahas , who was arrested on Monday after 102 days in hiding , is likely to be interrogated next week by the Brazilian judiciary . Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange %% raised %% the required margin on stock-margin transactions . China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony .

The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in the century ahead . A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth 's polar ice caps , %% raising %% the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas . `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen .
raise.v | 6 | The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $ 2 million , the Japanese government has put up just about as much , or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon , as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC 's `` Nightline . '' Punching away , we %% raised %% what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target . As one of his defenders so aptly put it , President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election ( and some would say thereafter as well ) . He was performing for pay , and why should anyone expect anything more ?
raise.v | 1 | But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations . The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further %% raises %% the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months .
raise.v | 4 | The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to %% raise %% funds in a hurry . According to the state department of finance , a one-penny increase in the state 's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $ 3 billion . Willie Brown , speaker of California 's Assembly , said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks .
raise.v | 1 | Northeast Utilities %% raised %% its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value claimed by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid .
raise.v | 1 | but worries about 1990 . With most legislatures adjourned for the year , small business is tallying its scorecard . Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from %% raising %% state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans . While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes Don L. Robinson , associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business organization . Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated .
raise.v | 1 | The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) . The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats . They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart %% raises %% and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal . They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow . The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
raise.v | 4 | `` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes . Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout . Mr. Keating %% raised %% $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering . He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
raise.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . Moody 's also said it %% raised %% its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .

Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market . Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election . Now , there have been a number of questions %% raised %% . '' Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point . New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday .

The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by %% raising %% or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .

Still , any change in East Germany has enormous implications , for both East and West . It %% raises %% the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow , Washington and Western Europe . Mr. Krenz , 52 , was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party 's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin . Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday .

They were studying the ground .
raise.v | 2 | Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he %% raised %% his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as usual , loved it .

Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle .

I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to %% raise %% the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .

Investors , who took profits Friday , mostly took a wait-and-see attitude Monday amid uncertainty in the foreign-currency market and New York stocks , traders said . Takamori Matsuda , an analyst at Dresdner-ABD Securities , said fading expectation for lower interest %% rates %% made investors step back from real-estate shares , which advanced last week . Some traders said institutions were waiting to see the U.S. jobless rate to be issued Friday .

rate.n | 1 | David Owen , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy . Robert White , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California , agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3\/4 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 13\/16 % . Fed funds is the %% rate %% banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the Fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system . Mr. White also predicted a half-point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future . The discount rate , currently 7 % , is the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral .
rate.n | 1 | Indeed , in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point . Several other European central banks , notably in Britain , followed the West German Bundesbank 's lead by raising their own key rates . And a week later , Japan raised its official discount %% rate %% by a half point to 3.75 % . The Japanese discount rate is the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks . After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 3\/4 % .
rate.n | 1 | `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen . Jens-Uwe Fischer , a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt , said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data , particularly U.S. trade figures , level off . He contended that the Fed wo n't ease rates further , but predicted Bundesbank officials will relax key %% rates %% in West Germany . Alfred Zapfel , chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt , took an opposite stance . He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November .
rate.n | 1 | At the same time , a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago . Comments by John Major , who has succeeded Mr. Lawson , also failed to damp market concern , despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates . According to one London-based analyst , even higher interest %% rates %% wo n't help the pound if Britain 's government continues to appear unstable . One U.S. trader , however , dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit . `` There is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should , '' he said .

Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $ 12.5 billion , about double the year-earlier %% rate %% .

Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary , however .
rate.n | 1 | `` And where we are is bad . '' Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year . That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the %% rate %% down sharply in August and September . Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .
rate.n | 1 | As expected , the longer-term tax-exempt New York bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term Treasury bonds . The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92 % . Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt New York City bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of Treasury %% rates %% , for any New York City issue in recent memory . A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainties . New York bonds , which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city 's economy is growing weaker , rose 1\/2 point yesterday .

rate.n | 1 | Currency traders , suspecting Mr. Major wo n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark . Analysts expect further jitters this week . A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base %% rate %% , currently 15 % . That could shove a weak economy into recession . Economists have been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought .

rate.n | 1 | The reason is simple . When a country cuts tax rates , it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency . It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax %% rates %% . Edouard Balladur , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship . The price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit .
rate.n | 1 | In February 1988 , for example , Merrill Lynch 's weekly commentary announced that `` the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989 . '' The forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds . It said long-term interest %% rates %% , then above 9 % , could drop to 7 % by the end of 1989 , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would be a good buy . The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40 % to 45 % and later to 55 % . But this September -- just when many market economists , including some at Merrill Lynch , believed that Mr. Straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a U-turn .
rate.n | 1 | So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher . The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps . There are the strict monetarists , who believe that floating exchange %% rates %% free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates . There are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates . And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians , who predict\/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows .
rate.n | 1 | We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience . Nearby Paul Craig Roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir Alan . Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating %% rates %% , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .

rate.n | 1 | The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market . As larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their own workers ' medical bills , the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them . `` Insurance companies will offer a good %% rate %% if no one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , '' says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau , a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide . `` One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40 % to 60 % . Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness . ''
rate.n | 1 | `` It 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under Lawson , '' says Malcolm Roberts , a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London . `` There 's very little upside to sterling , '' Mr. Roberts says , but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed Mr. Major 's appointment apparently has run its course . But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because Britain 's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual %% rate %% of about 7.6 % and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits . The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year , says Nigel Rendell , an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London . The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday , off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier .

Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity . An interest %% rate %% is guaranteed for between one and seven years , after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities . Some current rates exceed those on CDs . For instance , a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance , Chicago , offers 8.8 % interest for one year or a 9 % rate for two years .

rate.n | 1 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica . '' Under the plan , Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60 % of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price , according to officials involved in the agreement . The remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1\/4 % interest %% rate %% . The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from Japan . Treasury officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors , such as Mexico .

It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's Eurodollar contract , which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate , the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks .

rate.n | 1 | Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed exchange rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar %% rate %% was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .

FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION ( Fannie Mae ) : Posted yields on 30 year mortgage commitments for delivery within 30 days ( priced at par ) 9.68 % , standard conventional fixed-rate mortgages ; 8.70 % , 6\/2 rate capped one-year adjustable rate mortgages .
rate.n | 1 | The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , was just 7.77 % . The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96 % in the week ended Tuesday , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service . One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining %% rate %% environment is by extending the maturities of their investments , so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period . The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days , its longest since August . `` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said Walter Frank , chief economist for the Donoghue Organization , publisher of Money Fund Report .
rate.n | 2 | He did n't elaborate . But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value . Mr. Greenspan said the inflation %% rate %% , currently about 4 1\/2 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . '' In other words , economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years . But Mr. Greenspan , who has repeatedly said the Fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . ''
rate.n | 1 | The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire 's reorganization . They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire , where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization . Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit %% rate %% increases to satisfy the state . The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos , the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case , because the company 's stockholders , unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans . In addition , some of the proposals are so close , that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role .
rate.n | 2 | In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a %% rate %% , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake . Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk . Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic , the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R. 's Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany 's new maximum leader .
rate.n | 1 | But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar . Tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions . But it did n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping %% rate %% cut . The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market . As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the discrepancy has become ever greater .
rate.n | 2 | The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1 % %% rate %% of the two previous months , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said . The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier , reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries . The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year ; since February of this year , unemployment has been steady at around 6.2 % of the labor force .
rate.n | 1 | CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong . ABC , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts . While rights fees head skyward , ad %% rates %% wo n't . Advertisers already are balking at higher prices . `` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam .
rate.n | 1 | So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's . From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time . Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest %% rates %% , though up a bit recently , are still low . And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment . But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding .
rate.n | 1 | Mr. Bond indicated the consolidated debt figures , which include debt of units such as Bell Group Ltd. , will be published soon in Bond Corp. 's 1989 annual accounts . He predicted the debt will be reduced by another A$ 3.8 billion this fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , but did n't explain how this will be achieved . Mr. Bond blamed rising Australian interest %% rates %% and the acquisition of Bell Group `` with its very high levels of shortterm debt '' for producing a condition `` that was no longer sustainable . `` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders , '' Mr. Bond said , `` we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group . '' That reassessment resulted in continuing asset sales , as well as write-offs exceeding A$ 1.1 billion last fiscal year .
rate.n | 1 | On one-year CDs of $ 50,000 and less , the average slid to 8.02 % from 8.06 % . Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors . `` Because of shrinkage in the economy , %% rates %% can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon , '' said Norberto Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . `` It 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon . '' Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months .
rate.n | 1 | As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day , bond prices retreated . But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market . A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest %% rates %% tend to bolster bond prices . On the surface , the decline in September durable goods -- only 0.1 % -- did n't appear very weak . But orders for non-defense capital goods , a precursor of future plant and equipment spending , were off 5.6 % after falling 10.3 % in August .
rate.n | 1 | New England Electric System , Westborough , Mass. , has proposed buying the company for $ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years . The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan . The other bidder is United Illuminating Co. , New Haven , Conn. , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % %% rate %% increases .
rate.n | 1 | For example , student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral . The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount . High default %% rates %% , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high . Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates . In contrast , a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rates .
rate.n | 1 | So most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . A recent example is the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activities . This makes enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax accounts for more than 70 % of revenues and the capture %% rate %% of direct tax is so unfair . If you are a salaried man , Amen ! 100 % captured . If you are a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 % .
rate.n | 1 | LONDON LATE EURODOLLARS : 8 11\/16 % to 8 9\/16 % one month ; 8 5\/8 % to 8 1\/2 % two months ; 8 5\/8 % to 8 1\/2 % three months ; 8 9\/16 % to 8 7\/16 % four months ; 8 1\/2 % to 8 3\/8 % five months ; 8 7\/16 % to 8 5\/16 % six months . LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATES ( LIBOR ) : 8 11\/16 % one month ; 8 11\/16 % three months ; 8 1\/2 % six months ; 8 1\/2 % one year . The average of interbank offered %% rates %% for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks . FOREIGN PRIME RATES : Canada 13.50 % ; Germany 9 % ; Japan 4.875 % ; Switzerland 8.50 % ; Britain 15 % . These rate indications are n't directly comparable ; lending practices vary widely by location .
rate.n | 1 | `` They are holding their own in a weak market , and the restructuring is working , '' he says . David T. Kearns , Xerox chairman and chief executive officer , cited the restructuring and `` strong '' cost controls for the 13 % growth in profit from business products and systems operations . Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding , though , in financial services because of %% rate %% pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains . In the quarter , the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $ 200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations . The subsidiary also increased reserves by $ 140 million , however , and set aside an additional $ 25 million for claims connected with Hurricane Hugo .
rate.n | 2 | The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the %% rate %% of economic growth . Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics . If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
rate.n | 1 | The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink . `` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in %% rates %% , '' Mr. Ely said . For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion . For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion .
rate.n | 1 | In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' `` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said . The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest %% rate %% to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % . Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further .
rate.n | 2 | We ca n't afford to wait . '' But does it have to be so soon ? Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating %% rate %% , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. . Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
rate.n | 1 | But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery . The industrial average ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 points . Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest %% rates %% amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building . Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales .
rate.n | 1 | Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . Corporate Issues Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest %% rates %% . Three of the largest offerings , by Exxon Capital Corp. , Xerox Corp. and Citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc . Exxon Capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % .
rate.n | 1 | `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default %% rate %% of 34 % . One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 . These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by AP Industries , Columbia Savings ( Colorado ) , First Texas Savings Association , Gilbraltar Financial Corp. , Integrated Resources Inc. , Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. , Resorts International Inc. , Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc .
rate.n | 1 | A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year . Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . Belo said it increased its effective tax %% rate %% to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 . The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year .

rate.n | 1 | Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale . The Treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on Oct. 10 . The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount %% rate %% of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction . The rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively . Here are auction details :
rate.n | 1 | The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London . In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ( $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange %% rates %% ) , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .

rate.n | 2 | In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback . `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company . Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth %% rate %% of 26 % in the first half . In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier . The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
rate.n | 1 | Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . `` I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' The federal funds %% rate %% , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy . Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 3\/4 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report . Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 11\/16 % .
rate.n | 2 | The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . But the %% rate %% of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
rate.n | 2 | Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % . Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants . In the neighborhoods with the highest crime %% rates %% , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection . This creates several problems . One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .

rate.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest %% rates %% as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
rate.n | 1 | Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange %% rate %% mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
rate.n | 1 | At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' I call her agent , David Dominici . Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest %% rates %% stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . I do n't like the sound of that .
rate.n | 1 | Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest %% rates %% and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
rate.n | 1 | Information systems posted a loss of $ 8 million , compared with a loss of $ 9 million a year earlier . Customer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % . A 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest %% rates %% . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Contel closed at $ 33.75 a share , down .50 cents .
rate.n | 1 | Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . In the 15 companies I studied , reversal %% rates %% range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . 3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support .
rate.n | 1 | Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight %% rates %% . `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
rate.n | 1 | And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its %% rates %% a further 25 % over the next two years . Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .
rate.n | 1 | And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise %% rates %% on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April .
rate.n | 2 | First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance %% rates %% on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking . This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
rate.n | 1 | But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks . If so , that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so . That , in turn , is expected to persuade banks to cut their prime lending rate , a benchmark %% rate %% on many corporate and consumer loans , by half a percentage point , to 10 % . `` We 're not out of the woods yet by any means , '' said George R. Mateyo , president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co. , Cleveland . But the economy `` is slowing enough to give the Federal Reserve leeway to reduce interest rates . ''
rate.n | 1 | The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . The House seriously considered raising the top tax %% rate %% paid by individuals with the highest incomes . The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor ( D. , Ark . ) calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating .
rate.n | 1 | As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . That %% rate %% would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
rate.n | 1 | The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % . Short-term rates rose yesterday . The discount %% rate %% on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday . The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
rate.n | 1 | That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value ( plus , in some cases , a sweetener ) . When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest %% rates %% are puny . If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University .
rate.n | 1 | The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance . The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day . In the past several days , however , the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest %% rate %% to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets . Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy . Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September .

'' Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel 's offers of %% rate %% cuts . `` Everyone left , '' said Peter Lang , reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel .

Between 50 % and 75 % of today 's workers are covered by such plans , up from 5 % five years ago . `` Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does n't appear to have altered the long-term %% rate %% of increase in health-care costs , '' the Institute of Medicine , an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded after a two-year study . `` Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs , according to the report by a panel of health-care experts .
rate.n | 1 | Another reason for the weakness , he said , may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March . In August , rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit , but they inched down again through September . `` %% Rates %% have n't really peeled off that much , '' Mr. Regalia said . `` We 've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . '' Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous month .

Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company 's effective tax %% rate %% to 44 % from 37 % in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded , the company said . Pretax earnings declined 1.3 % . For the nine months , Los Angeles-based H.F.

rate.n | 2 | Eugene Sit , president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis , says , `` When we bought it , we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds ( the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for Uncle Sam 's check ) . But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth , Mr. Sit says . He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual %% rate %% ( down from about 14 % the past five years ) and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . That 's `` not bad , '' Mr. Sit says , but it sure does n't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . He wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , H&R Block does n't even come close .

After then , the House measure would boost the tax %% rate %% to 28 % and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation . Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent .

rate.n | 1 | However , he added , such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information . The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp. , which rose $ 2.75 to $ 86.50 , Nac Re Corp. , up $ 2 to $ 37.75 , American International Group Inc. , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 , and Cigna Corp. , up 87.5 cents to $ 62.50 . Yesterday , the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance %% rates %% , ending their long price wars . Before this bullish theory surfaced , some insurance stocks initially fell , indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money . In fact , Fireman 's Fund Corp. , which ended the day off 50 cents to $ 36.50 , said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit .
rate.n | 2 | Hence the LBO craze . But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way . The profit %% rate %% is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 . Result : a landscape littered with lemons , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America . The mounting risks did not go unobserved , even in the mid-1980s .

Money-fund assets have been rising at an average %% rate %% of $ 1.6 billion a week in recent months , Ms. Negus said , reflecting the relatively high yields .

rate.n | 2 | -- Among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge . Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years , the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 . The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty %% rate %% would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % -- under the alternative calculation . Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years . A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded , `` It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes . ''

As well , reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits . Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher %% rates %% in the industry , which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition . But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts . `` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for , '' he said .
rate.n | 1 | In Tokyo Thursday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen , down from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen . Since Friday 's dive in stock market prices , the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock market debacle . Some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and Tuesday 's California earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds %% rate %% . They say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the Fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level . The Fed did , in fact , execute $ 1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the third set of repurchase orders in three days .

Later , the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake . Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key %% rate %% increases in Europe and Japan , several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $ 12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange .

The G-7 comprises West Germany , the U.S. , France , the U.K. , Italy , Canada and Japan .
rate.n | 1 | Meanwhile , the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $ 90,000 fell to 7.93 % in the latest week , according to Banxquote , from 8.10 % the week before . Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs , but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding . CDs sold by major brokerage houses , which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest %% rate %% trends , also posted larger drops in yields . A six-month , broker-sold CD , for example , was yielding an average 8.09 % in the latest week , a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before . In late April , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks .
rate.n | 1 | Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations . Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $ 1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period . The move was meant to keep a lid on interest %% rates %% and to boost investor confidence . `` The intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez , money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . She said a more aggressive move was n't needed .
rate.n | 1 | But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest %% rate %% to decline about one-quarter percentage point . The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks .
rate.n | 2 | `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death %% rate %% from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % . The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites .
rate.n | 2 | `` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities . '' An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality `` among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking . '' But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality %% rates %% are rising in developing countries . `` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education . Asked for comment , Walker Merryman , a vice president of the Tobacco Institute , said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech .

rate.n | 1 | James G. Zafris , president of Danvers Savings Bank , Danvers , Mass. , says the market turmoil `` is an absolute non-event for small business . '' For small companies , he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges . Mr. Zafris thinks %% rates %% are heading down , helping small companies . Peter Drake , biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently .
rate.n | 2 | The amendment is aimed at skirting a Supreme Court ruling that threw out the conviction of a Texas flag-burner on grounds that his freedom of speech was violated . Federal researchers said lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline , particularly for white males . The National Cancer Institute also projected that overall U.S. mortality %% rates %% from lung cancer should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate . Bush met with South Korean President Roh , who indicated that Seoul plans to further ease trade rules to ensure that its economy becomes as open as the other industrialized nations by the mid-1990s . Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea .
recall.v | 1 | Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . '' In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % . `` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld %% recalls %% . Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % . The CD seemed like a great deal .

Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month , following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals . The FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was .

Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . `` People started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. Miranda recalls .
recall.v | 3 | The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford 's work , is wholly free of this anxiety .

The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to %% recall %% them . We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them . It does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose .

Under the new Northeast Utilities plan , it would pay $ 1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds . Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would %% receive %% only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds .

receive.v | 1 | But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members %% received %% amounted to bribes . Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ( $ 880,000 ) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .

receive.v | 1 | Readers of these columns ( `` The Science Police , '' May 15 ) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere . Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper . Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that %% receive %% its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era . This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science . John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .

Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month . The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year .
receive.v | 1 | Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .

With the $ 3 million %% received %% from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . `` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says . All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
receive.v | 1 | Loral Corp. said it received a $ 325 million order from Turkey 's Ministry of Defense , the largest contract the company ever has %% received %% . Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F-16 aircraft . The system provides radar-threat warning and electronic jamming capabilities .
receive.v | 2 | Helion also hoped that America 's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works . `` I arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions '' . In New York he was well %% received %% by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including Alexander Calder , George K.L. Morris , De Kooning , Holty and a few others . After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases . The darkening world scene , at the time of the Munich Pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote Virginia studio .
receive.v | 1 | Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who %% received %% the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
receive.v | 1 | Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition . The salary of the pastor had for years been $ 500 annually and even this was in arrears . Wilson made up his mind that he must %% receive %% at least $ 2,500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing . The church itself must be repaired . It was dirty and neglected .
receive.v | 1 | Jack , what is the nature of this concept '' ? ? `` It 's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said . `` We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has %% received %% is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given '' . His heart , he discovered , was pounding . `` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
receive.v | 1 | He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders . But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure . Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was %% receiving %% a much larger salary from parties unknown . He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups . In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .
receive.v | 2 | I could n't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . There , Mother was %% received %% by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats . But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .
regard.v | 1 | What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army . The weight of Lebanon 's history was also against him ; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating . Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , Israel is %% regarded %% by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians . Like Lebanon , Israel is being remade by demography .
regard.v | 3 | Interpublic declined comment . The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history . Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties %% regarding %% a possible restructuring . Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak . In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
regard.v | 1 | Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we can not %% regard %% `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we can not regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .
regard.v | 2 | Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and %% regarded %% us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .
regard.v | 1 | He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him . `` Three-day blow '' ! ! She bellowed triumphantly . He had noticed before that the natives seemed to %% regard %% really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists . `` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added . `` I hope so '' , he said .
remember.v | 1 | They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition . But they need not be to do their jobs well . Yes , we all can %% remember %% one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days . But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious . In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
remember.v | 1 | If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins . Always . This is worth %% remembering %% when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
remember.v | 1 | At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not %% remember %% , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now . We had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .
remember.v | 1 | These letters became the center of my existence . I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` %% Remember %% when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe . In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life . Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled .
remember.v | 1 | He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` %% Remember %% the Starbird ? ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down . `` The Starbird , '' Abel said . There was the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished .
remember.v | 1 | They had already lost most of their corn , she thought . Were they to be insulted again because of the South 's great victory ? ? She %% remembered %% McClellan 's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs . At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door . Juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth .
remember.v | 1 | To fuck up the program . You guys remember that . %% Remember %% that He heard himself haranguing them . He saw himself before them delivering the speech . He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention .
remember.v | 1 | Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless . Gavin 's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words . `` Do you %% remember %% Big Charlie '' ? ? He whispered . `` He stuck with me all these years . Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .
remember.v | 1 | `` When you got ta go , you got ta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said . Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he %% remembered %% of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley . `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said . `` Can I make you one '' ? ?
remember.v | 1 | `` So I just scooted out of his clutches . I swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car . The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I %% remembered %% that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I 'd changed '' . She 'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she 'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool . While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd seen two men on her left at the pool 's edge .
remember.v | 1 | Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden . Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards . She closed her eyes , %% remembering %% the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
remember.v | 1 | He was determined to hold out . The Old Man 's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich . At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother , that he could n't %% remember %% her face or her touch ; ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him . He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have cared less about that either . To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .
remember.v | 1 | It was true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala . The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . He found himself trying to %% remember %% something , but he could n't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together .
remember.v | 1 | `` She should have told me herself . And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ? %% Remember %% what happened the last time '' ? ? Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them . Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra 's husband , had n't gone out to fetch her .
remember.v | 1 | But he was always persuaded out . He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never %% remember %% whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .
remove.v | 1 | In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid , Mr. Ortega 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections . Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections . Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to %% remove %% any pressure to hold fair elections . `` My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning '' by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency , he said .
remove.v | 1 | Staar Surgical Co. 's board said that it has %% removed %% Thomas R. Waggoner as president and chief executive officer and that John R. Wolf , formerly executive vice president , sales and marketing , has been named president and chief executive officer . Mr. Waggoner has been involved in a dispute with the board since August , when he ousted all the directors . Later they said they fired him , and two directors attempted to place the company under bankruptcy-law protection .
remove.v | 1 | AG is hardly alone in its anxiety . A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once-stately insurance business . Worried by European Community directives that will %% remove %% many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars . In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
remove.v | 1 | Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , %% remove %% the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ? That is questionable , to say the least . Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .
remove.v | 1 | For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant . She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city 's special nursery . Soon they all were %% removed %% to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began . One of the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva 's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells . Instead of kicking feet , Helva 's neural responses started her wheels ; ; instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .
remove.v | 1 | There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain . `` Have him come in '' . Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously %% removed %% from their customary places . `` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely . An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
replace.v | 1 | Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates . And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $ 49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March . The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras , %% replaced %% the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988 . While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) said yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . ''
replace.v | 1 | It did , shaking the apple establishment to its roots . Now , even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed . `` The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to %% replace %% the Red Delicious , '' he says . The Delicious hegemony wo n't end anytime soon . New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom .
replace.v | 1 | Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs . At closely held Deltec Securities Corp. , junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise . In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to %% replace %% them . Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said .
replace.v | 1 | The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs . So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change . What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to %% replace %% them . Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago . A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
replace.v | 1 | Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress . That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment . Hands-off the economy was %% replaced %% by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution . In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state's-responsibility '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus . The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .
replace.v | 1 | It was so dark that he did n't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had %% replaced %% his biwa with a friend . An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
report.v | 1 | It was an audacious claim . But in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believed Dr. Knudson was right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers . His was one of two research teams in 1984 to %% report %% dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm 's tumor . Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer . He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages .
report.v | 1 | Cie . Generale des Eaux %% reported %% that net profit climbed 30 % in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25 % for the full year . The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs ( US$ 119.2 million ) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988 . Revenue climbed 13 % to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion .
report.v | 1 | Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 725.8 million ) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans , bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$ 1 billion . The bank said the C$ 1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$ 595 million against earnings but said it still expects to %% report %% a profit for the year ending Tuesday . The bank reported net income of C$ 389 million for the nine months ended July 31 . The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions wo n't affect the payment of dividends .
report.v | 1 | Since then , deliveries have slumped . GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid-October to 69,980 , while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 . GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers %% reported %% mixed results . All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made cars , including those built at Japanese-managed plants , falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier . The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
report.v | 1 | But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out . Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville wo n't discard his old supply . ( He %% reports %% his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . ) CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts .
report.v | 1 | `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . '' AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government %% reports %% about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing .
report.v | 1 | Economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing . While they do n't expect the Fed to move right away , they say the case for lower rates is building . Yesterday , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while the nation 's auto makers %% reported %% lackluster mid-October sales . The Treasury 's 30-year bond ended over 1\/4 point higher . Municipal , mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1\/8 to 1\/2 point .
report.v | 1 | Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates . Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was %% reported %% earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say . `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer .
report.v | 1 | The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job . Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed . Crime was the reason that 26 % %% reported %% difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving . More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises . In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
report.v | 1 | Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back . It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who %% report %% low income and large expenses from a part-time business . The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields . For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .
report.v | 1 | But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience . The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research . Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium %% reported %% results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons . The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium . When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .
report.v | 1 | The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it %% reports %% operating results this week . Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .
report.v | 1 | Argentina and Britain agreed to resume diplomatic and economic relations , seven years after the two nations battled over the Falkland Islands . The announcement , in which they said hostilities had ceased , followed a two-day meeting in Madrid . Rebel artillerists bombarded the capital of Afghanistan , killing at least 12 people , as the Soviet Union was %% reported %% to be airlifting arms and food to Kabul 's forces . Fighting also was reported around the strategic town of Khost , near the Pakistani border . Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister met in Damascus with President Assad to develop a plan for the withdrawal of Syria 's 40,000 troops from Lebanon as part of a settlement of that nation 's 14-year-old civil war .
report.v | 1 | Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces . Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn . Rep. Bill McCollum ( R. , Fla. ) %% reports %% that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards , ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms . Meanwhile , the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics . In this they are aided by years of American , European , Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public .
report.v | 1 | He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor -- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy . He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions . He was to get involved in no arguments ; ; he was to try to make no converts ; ; he was simply to listen and %% report %% back what he heard . It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent . If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .
report.v | 2 | Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . It was %% reported %% to Welch 's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . Welch wanted to know why . No one knew .
rush.v | 1 | Over the past four years , the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually , according to Donald Kummerfeld , president of the Magazine Publishers of America . `` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. Kummerfeld . `` Entrepreneurs do n't %% rush %% to get into a stagnant or declining industry . '' And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around . For the first nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 pages .
rush.v | 1 | They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country . `` The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps . Nothing appalling or horrible %% rushed %% upon these men . Only there happened -- nothing . There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .

say.v | 1 | Banca Nazionale del Lavoro %% said %% its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ( $ 872 million ) , marking the bank 's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch . BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $ 3 billion without the Rome-based management 's approval . State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties .
say.v | 4 | All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union , and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months . The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West . Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but %% said %% an `` Association of the Unemployed '' has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets , or 17 % of the work force . An 11-week dispute involving Australia 's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent 's tourist industry . `` The only people who are flying are those who have to , '' said Frank Moore , chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association .
say.v | 1 | Earlier this year , Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $ 600 million a year . Friday 's auction will be limited to $ 150 million disbursed by the Central Bank to potential investors . The office of foreign investment has authorized some $ 1.78 billion worth of investment proposals , %% said %% Edwin Perozo , superintendent of foreign investment . Most of the proposals are in tourism , basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects , he said . Under the debt-equity program , potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at , and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers .
say.v | 1 | In Washington , the Senate voted to condemn Ortega 's threat to cancel the truce , and Bush said he would review U.S. policy toward Managua , including the possibility of renewing military aid to the rebels . Chinese leader Deng told former President Nixon that the U.S. was deeply involved in `` the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion '' that gripped Beijing last spring . Nixon , on the fourth day of a private visit to China , %% said %% that damage to Sino-U.S. relations was `` very great , '' calling the situation `` the most serious '' since 1972 . Afghanistan 's troops broke through a guerrilla blockade on the strategic Salang Highway , allowing trucks carrying food and other necessities to reach Kabul after a missile attack on rebel strongholds . The convoy of about 100 vehicles was the first to make deliveries to the capital in about 10 days .
say.v | 1 | The law , which Bush allowed to take effect without his signature , went into force Friday . Chinese officials said armed police would replace soldiers in Tiananmen Square as part of a scaling down of Beijing 's five-month-old state of emergency . Separately , the U.S. Embassy has filed three protests in as many days with China 's government , alleging harassment of diplomats and their families , an embassy source %% said %% . Authorities in Algeria said the toll from two earthquakes Sunday had reached at least 30 dead and about 250 injured . The heaviest damage was reported in Tipasa , about 40 miles west of Algiers .
say.v | 1 | Right now about a dozen laboratories , in the U.S. , Canada and Britain , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes . They have about seven candidates . Researchers %% say %% the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects .
say.v | 1 | The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes . It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close to doing that so far . In any case , %% says %% Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer .
say.v | 1 | Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed , Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals . If further research proves the seed 's benefits , this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil . `` This seed 's not grown anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world , '' %% says %% T.V. Krishnamurthy , a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd. , a major psyllium buyer and promoter . `` The proper climatic conditions do n't exist in many places in the world . '' Arvind Patel , a processor and exporter of the seed , raves : `` If psyllium takes the place of oat bran , it will be huge . ''
say.v | 1 | `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen . These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers %% said %% , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change . Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said . Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
say.v | 1 | The humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras , replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988 . While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month , Mr. Ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued . Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole ( R. , Kan . ) %% said %% yesterday on `` Meet the Press '' : `` I would hope after his { Mr. Ortega 's } act yesterday or the day before , we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid . '' Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader . While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question , rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration , Mr. Ortega 's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue .
say.v | 1 | It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras . On Oct. 20 , the town 's mayor , Robert Reid , made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers . `` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' %% says %% Joe Sukle , the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown . `` They 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards . They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama . ''
say.v | 1 | `` I do n't talk about my work , '' he says . The president of CBS News , David W. Burke , did n't return numerous telephone calls . One person close to the process %% says %% it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a `` work in progress , '' such as the Hoffman re-creation , but says CBS News is `` aware '' of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman 's former wife . Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment . Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed .
say.v | 1 | As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs . The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts %% say %% . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
say.v | 1 | Veiling his message has helped him endure . Art , says the playwright in `` Wedding Song , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take . '' `` Wedding Song '' gives glimpses of a Cairo that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once %% said %% , `` the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty . '' The clutter of the 1940s remains , but its color has drained away , and the will to overcome has been defeated . Cars ca n't move because of overflowing sewers .
say.v | 1 | He points to a letter on his desk , his second in a week from President Bush , saying that they `` do n't disagree . '' More broadly , Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power . `` Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force , '' he %% says %% . Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren . But it 's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess , the problem goes beyond legal interpretation .
say.v | 1 | The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer . OPEC Secretary-General Subroto explains : Consumers offer security of markets , while OPEC provides security of supply . `` This is an opportune time to find mutual ways { to prevent } price shocks from happening again , '' he %% says %% . To promote this balance , OPEC now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem . At its November meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy Persian Gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments .
say.v | 1 | It says 40 % of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988 's . Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable . Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official %% says %% . Outside investors , scarce since '86 , are edging back . Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says William Thomas , a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''
say.v | 1 | `` We have the money to buy . But operating a U.S. department-store chain would be very difficult , '' says Motoyuki Homma , managing director of the international division at Mitsukoshi Ltd. , one of Japan 's leading department stores . Japanese retail executives %% say %% the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the U.S. is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles . The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U.S. market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo n't translate into success in the U.S. . Japanese department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity .
say.v | 1 | Hoping to avoid another takeover , Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . Ideally , investment bankers say , he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network . `` When you look at the economics , Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work , '' %% says %% one investment banker who follows the retail industry . `` Looking only at a narrow American strategy is n't where it 's at . '' Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry is n't likely to be so easy , analysts say .
say.v | 4 | But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $ 57.2 million . A statement from the council of cardinals said Catholics had responded generously to an appeal last year to give more money after 1987 's record $ 63 million deficit . The statement %% said %% a 5 % jump in the `` Peter 's Pence '' collection -- the annual offering from Catholics to the pope -- helped cover the deficit . Council member Cardinal Gerald Carter of Toronto told Vatican Radio : `` Now that we say we covered our deficit this year , people are going to relax and say well that 's fine , the Holy See is out of the hole . But we 're ... going to be in the exact same situation next year . ''
say.v | 1 | Chinese officials are trying to use the Canton Trade Fair to lure back overseas traders after the bloody crackdown on dissent . But attendance is down from previous years . What 's more , a Hong Kong textile trader %% says %% , some Chinese exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown by dragging their feet on soliciting new business . `` They are angry about the government ... so they hold back the goods , '' he said . This autumn 's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31 .
say.v | 1 | Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog , the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of Luzon . Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer English . But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino , %% say %% advocates of the native language . `` For the middle and upper-middle class { Filipino } is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines . There 's also resentment .
say.v | 1 | He called the battle `` uphill . '' Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic . `` There will be no capital-gains bill this year , '' %% said %% Sen. Dale Bumpers ( D. , Ark . ) . `` I 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal . The IRA portion ( of the Packwood-Roth plan ) is irresponsible . ''
say.v | 1 | Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the `` disappearance '' of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs ( about $ 465,000 ) , there had n't been any stock-taking since 1868 . Tony Lambert , Mrs. Verne 's successor , says the mint 's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs . El Salvador is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses , government officials %% said %% . The state Supply Regulator Institute is to burn rice , corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government , a statement from the information service SISAL said . During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute , then sold at low prices to `` unscrupulous businessmen '' who resold them to the institute at inflated prices , the statement said .
say.v | 1 | Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting , a ministry spokesman said . They also wanted to prevent a NATO training base being built in the region , he said . The action , in the Canadian Federal Court , will be against Canada , the Netherlands , West Germany , Britain and the U.S. , the ministry spokesman %% said %% . Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation , an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said . Japan has been testing imported food from Europe since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union , the spokesman said .
say.v | 1 | The highlight : a `` fragrance control system . '' With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents , all blown in through the car 's air-conditioning system . The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee %% says %% Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two . Welcome to the 28th Tokyo Motor Show . Here you can find Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying a `` live fish transporter , '' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels , and Nissan Motor Co. with its `` keyless '' Boga , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner 's fingerprints .
say.v | 1 | If the law leaves loopholes , use them . If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . And if you are caught or if people complain , simply argue that `` everyone does it '' or `` no one %% said %% I should n't '' and brazen it out . As a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . ( See , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful . )
say.v | 1 | Not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings . But many have . `` These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people , '' %% says %% Washington writer Suzanne Garment , who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal . Given their own penchant for book writing , it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art . For there is an emerging protocol -- indeed , an etiquette -- to it .
say.v | 1 | `` My husband was instantly impoverished by the very act of marrying me , '' she says . Another former EPA official , Rita Lavelle , is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges . `` There 's nothing she could do to bring herself back to where she was , '' %% says %% her lawyer , James Bierbower . `` You could say she survived , but it was n't easy on her . '' No book contracts have been dangled before Deborah Gore Dean , the reigning queen of the HUD scandal .
say.v | 1 | Ford Motor Co. %% said %% it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by W. Wayne Booker . Ford Asia-Pacific will coordinate the activities of Ford subsidiaries in Japan , Australia , Taiwan and New Zealand and work with Ford business associates throughout the region .

say.v | 1 | Running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother . In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan . In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush %% said %% he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote . As Mr. Reagan 's running mate , though , Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion . He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life .
say.v | 1 | Nonetheless , the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars . In Cupertino , Calif. , Apple said that it believes the case has no merit , and that HyperCard does not infringe `` any valid claims '' of the Quickview patents .

say.v | 4 | The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division . Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer . News reports %% said %% yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .
say.v | 1 | The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed . Under the proposal , Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share , though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share . Yesterday , Delmed %% said %% it `` continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA . '' It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination `` would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced . '' While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued , Delmed will continue to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990 , Delmed said .
say.v | 1 | `` Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available , '' said Jack Nusbaum , co-chairman of Willkie Farr . `` It 's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical . '' Some lawyers %% say %% the slump , while more obvious in recent weeks , began earlier this year . Dennis Block , a partner at the New York firm of Weil , Gotshal & Manges , said that in the first eight months of this year , 89 hostile offers were launched , compared with 157 for the first eight months of What 's more , he said , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts .
say.v | 1 | In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff , the defense accused one of the government 's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff . Mr. Laff 's attorney , John Lang , filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness , Henry Lorin , told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed . The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang %% said %% was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff . In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it . In March , Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy , mail and securities fraud , and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
say.v | 1 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications . Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 . The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , %% said %% Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T . The products already available are cross-connect systems , used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment . This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said .
say.v | 1 | Earlier this month , the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act . But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets , the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which Congress continues to work . `` If that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' %% said %% press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill . Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there .
say.v | 1 | Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes . Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 . Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' %% says %% John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations . The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . '' Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders .
say.v | 1 | `` But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening . '' The powerful group , which represents many of the nation 's telemarketers , was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill . Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill , %% saying %% the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders , causing irritation and even errors . Laura Dale , center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in Reno , Nev. , defends monitoring . `` We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service , '' says Ms. Dale , who supervises 350 operators .
say.v | 1 | Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally . `` Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose , '' says Bernard Appel , president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary . He %% says %% he has n't yet studied the Dellums bill , but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . '' Still , Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial . A few years ago , the company voluntarily stopped selling `` The Big Ear , '' a powerful microphone .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender . In the mid-1980s , after ABC had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 Winter Games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices . `` I love Pilson , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' %% says %% Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president . `` And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today . '' Rivals carp at `` the principle of Pilson , '' as NBC 's Arthur Watson once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . ''
say.v | 1 | Next October , CBS , for the first time , wo n't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series . `` I 've been struggling against that for years , '' says Jonathan Rodgers , who runs WBBM-TV , the CBS-owned station in Chicago . Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC , '' he %% says %% . That is n't surprising . Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. Pilson says .
say.v | 1 | Price : $ 265 million . But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17 % less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month . Moreover , `` there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably '' from the GM-Toyota price , %% says %% Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc . Other admen , however , say rates could rise later if ad spending surges . The Winter Games outlook also is mixed .
say.v | 1 | CBS may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling CBS Records and other businesses . But media-stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says Wall Street wo n't take kindly to that . `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he %% says %% . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really asking is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says .
say.v | 1 | The American depositary receipts of Jaguar jumped 3\/8 to 11 5\/8 on turnover of 1.9 million . Ford Motor said it raised its stake in the British car maker to 12.45 % of the ordinary shares outstanding . In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Ford %% said %% it holds 22.8 million ordinary shares . The company has said it is prepared to make a bid for all of the shares outstanding of Jaguar if British government restrictions to such a transaction are removed .

Campeau Corp. , the chain 's owner , declined to comment on the report . A spokeswoman %% said %% Toronto-based Campeau has received `` expressions of interest '' in Bloomingdale 's , but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made . Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's leading economic newspaper , reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning to team up with U.S. and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain , which Campeau has put up for sale . The service did n't identify its Tokyu sources .

say.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers %% said %% the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .

IBM , which said Motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in .

Viacom officials declined to comment . Jerome Kern , Tele-Communications ' chief outside counsel , %% said %% he was n't aware of Time 's legal plans . But he said that any effort by Time to characterize the Tele-Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be `` the pot calling the kettle black .

say.v | 1 | But that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks , the agency said . The office , an arm of the Treasury , said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often .

Dealers %% said %% the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year . The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said .

say.v | 1 | The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes . A Board of Control spokesman %% said %% the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .

say.v | 1 | The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a `` monster . '' Needless to %% say %% , he was talking about RICO .

The text of the `` new policy '' guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby .

Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified .

say.v | 1 | But it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , %% said %% she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners . Mr. Yeutter , seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990 .
say.v | 1 | To hear most U.S. growers tell it , we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve . But how sweet it is . It has more sugar `` than any apple we 've ever tested , '' %% says %% Duane Greene , a University of Massachusetts pomologist , or apple scholar . It has a long shelf life and `` does n't fool the public , '' says Grady Auvil , an Orondo , Wash. , grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them . `` It does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside . ''
say.v | 1 | Even if a grower beats them back , his $ 2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors ' orchards instead of pollinating his , Mr. Broderick says . Though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala , a sweet New Zealand native ; the Esopus Spitzenburg , reportedly Thomas Jefferson 's favorite apple ; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty . `` I 've ripped out a lot of Delicious '' and grafted the trees with many different shoots , %% says %% Steve Wood , a West Lebanon , N.H. , grower , tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently . `` I 've got 70 kinds of apples . Here 's a Waltana , '' he exclaims , picking one off a tree .
say.v | 1 | But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched . Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures . Sheraton and Pan Am %% said %% they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture . The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $ 140 to $ 150 a day for each of its rooms , and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets , according to a Sheraton executive . Thomas Plaskett , Pan Am 's chairman , said the U.S. airline 's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights .
say.v | 1 | `` Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists , the neighborhood groups , dealing with traffic mitigation , sewers and fighting city hall , then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money , buy a portfolio , sell off pieces off it and play your own game ? '' says Jack Rodman , managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm . But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties , finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy . The level of interest in the RTC 's properties has been greater than expected , and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated , %% says %% Stan Ross , Leventhal 's co-managing partner . And to succeed in the turnaround business , he says , developers may have to put in a lot of money and time . Finding pension funds and other sources willing to invest is a high priority .
say.v | 1 | Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down . `` We spend a fortune on research information , '' said Steve Burzon , publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home . And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , %% said %% advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , president of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
say.v | 1 | The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision , Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says . If you assign your income to another , you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor , even if indirectly . Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them , the IRS %% says %% ; of course , he also may take a charitable deduction for them .

say.v | 1 | New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the Commerce Department reported . Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9 % in August , the department %% said %% . Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August . Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
say.v | 1 | Italy 's unemployment rate rose to 12 % of the labor force in July from 11.9 % in April , and was up from 11.7 % a year earlier , according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute . Istat %% said %% a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April , and from 2,853,000 a year ago .

say.v | 1 | The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- `` it cost them , '' Mr. Kriz said . Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit `` has taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we think these will serve to improve credit quality . '' As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought to ease , he %% said %% . But he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market . Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results .
say.v | 1 | Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat . Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15 , satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the PLO . A U.S. counterterrorism official %% said %% experts are studying the Israeli list . `` We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15 , 1988 , '' he said , referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads . `` So far , this list does n't change our view .
say.v | 1 | At the heart of Israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah , including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails . But U.S. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah , the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories , which the U.S. does n't classify as terrorism . In addition , the officials %% say %% Israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by Fatah or by any group Mr. Arafat controls . U.S. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the New York Times . The papers , which Israel says were discovered in Israeli-occupied Gaza , refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called `` the Revolutionary Eagles . ''
say.v | 1 | These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . Officials in some of these states %% say %% they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
say.v | 1 | Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue . Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said . Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , %% said %% , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . '' Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
say.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , %% said %% Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
say.v | 1 | Eagle Clothes Inc. , which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , %% said %% it reached an agreement with its creditors .

say.v | 1 | `` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . '' Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying . He %% says %% that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch . But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks . The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
say.v | 1 | `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it %% says %% the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .

'' But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out .
say.v | 1 | One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay . But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . Although one transportation official %% said %% drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
say.v | 1 | Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' %% says %% Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently . But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in .
say.v | 1 | The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation . `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' %% says %% Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work .
say.v | 1 | Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors . `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies %% says %% .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned . `` The magazine is strong . It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. Lipstein %% said %% . `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added .
say.v | 1 | Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided . An accountant did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . `` I guess I was naive , '' he %% said %% . There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense . Corporate managers who want to start their own business are the highest failure risks .
say.v | 1 | `` They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together , but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan , '' he said . Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners . `` Five years ago , magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser 's big ad schedule for their magazine , '' %% said %% Mr. Murphy . `` But the marketplace changed . Advertisers now say ` Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . '
say.v | 1 | `` We think we 're on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration , '' he said . `` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter . '' Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he %% said %% the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market . In major market activity : Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 135.9 million shares .
say.v | 4 | Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads . The report to Congress %% said %% that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates .
say.v | 1 | In driftnet , or `` wall of death , '' fishing , fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path . Earlier this year , Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds , or down to 20 . Workers at Peugeot S.A. 's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman %% said %% . The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses . The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly plant at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 .
say.v | 1 | MINORITY RECRUITING has yet to meet hopes raised by Bush administration . Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they %% said %% was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring .
say.v | 1 | In Japan , by contrast , companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within . The Japanese also are accused of keeping their cards too close to their vests . `` Some Japanese executives are not yet ... comfortable about sharing strategic information with their American colleagues , '' the researchers %% say %% . Americans stay longer with Japanese firms than American companies . But they think promotions are limited .
say.v | 1 | `` There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who know their responsibilities , '' he says . THE CHECKOFF : At least somebody gains on layoffs . The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms %% says %% the industry 's volume has soared tenfold since 1980 , to $ 350 million a year ... . And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89 , the benefits test fought by most employers . Triad Solutions says software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now have no use .
say.v | 1 | The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they %% said %% . The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''
say.v | 1 | Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir . A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan .

say.v | 1 | The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 1.71 billion during the first eight months of 1989 from $ 807 million a year earlier . Imports continued to outpace Philippine exports , despite gains in shipments abroad , the government National Statistics Office %% said %% . Exports reached $ 5.12 billion , up from $ 4.52 billion a year earlier , while imports rose to $ 6.81 billion from $ 5.33 billion . The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $ 1.09 billion for all of 1988 .
say.v | 1 | Lloyd 's of London %% said %% it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years . Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd 's , the world 's largest insurance market , generally do n't close their accounts for three years , to allow for the filing of claims and litigation . When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
say.v | 1 | The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay area officials %% said %% nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Wolf and other members of the board declined to comment on the announcement . Mr. Waggoner could n't be reached . The Staar board also %% said %% that John R. Ford resigned as a director , and that Mr. Wolf was named a member of the board .
say.v | 1 | TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee 's , a fast-food restaurant , and operates several other food chains . Donaldson Lufkin would n't comment . Credit analysts %% said %% investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company 's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt . Also , the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities , which are currently unpopular . Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury 's sale of $ 10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday .
say.v | 1 | The bonds were won by a Goldman , Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % . They were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20 % in 2009 . The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter %% said %% . Mortgage - , Asset-Backed Securities Mortgage securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with Government National Mortgage Association 8 % securities as the standout issue .
say.v | 1 | People who have seen SCI TV 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp . They would both give part of their combined $ 50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV 's $ 488 million of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . But some militant SCI TV junk-holders %% say %% that 's not enough . They contend that SCI TV 's equity now is worthless . They add that it is n't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think contributed to SCI TV 's current problems .
say.v | 1 | December copper opened near Monday 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day . Stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price . William Kaiser , president of the Kaiser Financial Group in Chicago , %% said %% the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market , which partly reflected a weakening economy . He said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing . Mr. Kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago .
say.v | 1 | `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . '' She %% said %% copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday . However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year . Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .
say.v | 1 | He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized . Ms. Raptopoulos thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar . `` Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did '' yesterday , she %% said %% . Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday , which is historically high . `` The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said .
say.v | 1 | Japan 's production of cars , trucks and buses in September fell 4.1 % from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers ' Association %% said %% . Domestic demand continues to grow , but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2 % fall in imports , accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas , according to the association . The association said domestic demand grew 8.8 % in September .
say.v | 1 | An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way . The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said . Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House %% said %% the congressmen 's letter is under review . The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years . Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
say.v | 1 | Harsco Corp. said it obtained a $ 33.1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment . Harsco declined to say what country placed the order . The company %% said %% it received an order for 23 of the vehicles , which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged , and an option for 16 more . Delivery is to begin in early 1991 . Harsco produces products for defense , industrial , commercial and construction markets .
say.v | 1 | The company sells image . Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons . The Maidenform name `` is part of American pop culture , '' %% says %% Joan Sinopoli , account supervisor of the campaign by Levine , Huntley , Schmidt & Beaver , a New York ad firm . Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . You never know where she 'll turn up . ''
say.v | 1 | It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc. , the intimate apparel division , and Playtex Family Products Corp. , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products . Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel . Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , %% says %% Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously . When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says . The company could command a good price in the market .
say.v | 1 | Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says . He notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing . In addition , he %% says %% , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . '' And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. Durkin says , `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . '' Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . ''
say.v | 1 | `` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ? That 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . '' `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he %% says %% , `` because she taught me how to listen . Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber .
say.v | 1 | Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers . Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs . It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' %% says %% Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology . The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division . Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
say.v | 1 | Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , %% said %% it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group . Rhone-Poulenc , a chemical and pharmaceutical company , said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $ 900 million . It did n't release terms of the transaction .
say.v | 1 | Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds . Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more . `` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' %% says %% Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum . Just last week , would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock 's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off , foiled . `` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
say.v | 1 | She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car . Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she %% says %% . Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''
say.v | 1 | `` I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks . I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza . So I %% said %% , ` Hello . ' And she said , ` Hello . ' Can you imagine ?
say.v | 1 | Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party . These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . `` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' %% says %% Mr. Revson . `` It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . '' But name-dropping has other benefits , often civic .
say.v | 1 | He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis . He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions . `` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler %% says %% . There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name-dropping . Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
say.v | 1 | Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating . `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' %% says %% Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company . In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so . Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe Treasury securities .
say.v | 1 | Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress . And , Deltec %% said %% , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said . Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
say.v | 1 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' %% says %% Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
say.v | 1 | Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market . In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips . Military buyers have shown interest , National %% says %% , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation . And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds . Showing Up in Court Without Being There
say.v | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen %% says %% he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
say.v | 1 | `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you turn it off ? '' That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she %% said %% , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) . `` If you are born to give parties , you give parties . Even in Russia we managed to give parties .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez %% says %% he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously .
say.v | 1 | He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others . Rep. Jim Leach ( R. , Iowa ) %% says %% the Lincoln S&L affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making . '' A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally . But the witness , William Crawford , California 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that .
say.v | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel %% said %% . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
say.v | 1 | The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . Detrex is setting aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . In addition , the manufacturer %% said %% it signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $ 1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $ 48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute .
say.v | 1 | A crowd estimated at 100,000 held a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman %% said %% .

Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , %% said %% profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are estimated at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million .
say.v | 1 | Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . Exxon %% said %% in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct . The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
say.v | 1 | Gerald C. Beddall , 47 years old , was named president of the Clairol division of this pharmaceuticals and health-care company . He succeeds C. Benjamin Brooks Jr. , who will retire Nov. 1 . Mr. Brooks declined to give his age , but he %% said %% his leaving is a normal retirement .

say.v | 1 | Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August . `` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities %% said %% . `` It 's better to wait .

say.v | 1 | The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges . The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August , prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market . Traders %% say %% that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street , the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data . They noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day . In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen late Friday .
say.v | 1 | Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .

But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
say.v | 1 | When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash . But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors %% say %% there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market . `` Their principal asset is Manville common stock , '' says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville shares . `` If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
say.v | 1 | Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term . Its stock , at 9 5\/8 , trades at about 8 1\/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers . Mr. Bullock %% says %% 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management .

say.v | 1 | So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . While some %% say %% the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp .

say.v | 1 | For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts %% said %% , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . '' A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
say.v | 1 | Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit .

'' Some maintain underwriters also have been inept . John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 .
say.v | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. %% said %% it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company .

That would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters .

So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically %% said %% that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency .

A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 .
say.v | 1 | The British Petroleum Co. PLC %% said %% its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea . In an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
say.v | 1 | The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' %% said %% Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group . In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
say.v | 1 | `` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine . In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley ( D. , Wash . ) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change . Mr. Bush %% said %% he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately . In June , the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the First Amendment .
say.v | 1 | Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook . The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year . Hoechst %% said %% the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand .
say.v | 1 | John Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know . He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he %% says %% . The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns . `` We 're all a little greedy .
say.v | 1 | `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . '' ( Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation . He %% says %% he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . ) For some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived . `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
say.v | 1 | Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches . But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . Psychologists %% say %% isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves . For instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? ''
say.v | 1 | Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him . Mr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invested some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns . `` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' %% says %% Mr. Cortese . `` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . '' The investment is worth about $ 130 today .
say.v | 1 | Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , %% says %% Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
say.v | 1 | Their compounding effect is also alluring . In June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 . But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , %% says %% zeros are particularly ill-suited . Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal .
say.v | 1 | Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges . Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors . `` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones %% says %% , `` but no intent to defraud . '' Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .
say.v | 1 | Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , %% says %% that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff . ( Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization .
say.v | 1 | They want it back . Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for court . But he does %% say %% that all of his activities have been `` entirely proper . '' On the suit by the limited partners , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs . The suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . ''
say.v | 1 | When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? Pencils down . If you 're like most people , you %% said %% it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding . `` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
say.v | 1 | The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies . Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . The surge in production , analysts %% say %% , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
say.v | 1 | `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now . `` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he %% says %% . Why Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . He probably has n't done it for the cash .
say.v | 1 | The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty %% says %% profits will be flat or lower . And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
say.v | 1 | With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest . `` The industry is overbuilt , '' he %% says %% . `` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available .
say.v | 1 | Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . He %% says %% courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
say.v | 1 | Silver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . `` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers . While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar %% says %% . Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
say.v | 1 | Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he %% says %% . Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .
say.v | 1 | Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say . Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland . Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he %% says %% . However , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most . Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week :
say.v | 1 | But whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . '' Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , %% said %% that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound .
say.v | 1 | Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results . But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . `` The results were fascinating , '' he %% said %% . On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat . The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
say.v | 1 | Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory %% said %% researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
say.v | 1 | And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . `` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' %% says %% a 30-year-old East German doctor . `` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning .
say.v | 1 | The incident occurred Saturday night . The Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting . Scientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. %% said %% . The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells . Died : Alfred Hayes , 79 , former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Saturday , in New Canaan , Conn .
say.v | 1 | Alusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. . Alusuisse , of New York , declined to %% say %% how much it expects to get for the unit ; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders . Alusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. , a Zurich , Switzerland , producer of aluminum , chemicals and packaging products . Consolidated , which had 1988 revenue of $ 400 million , makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal , Ohio , and Jackson , Tenn. , rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run , W.Va .
say.v | 1 | WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp . The 10 7\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , %% said %% $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program .
say.v | 1 | Chambers Development Co. %% said %% its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $ 2.1 million of annual revenue . Purchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry . Terms were n't disclosed .
say.v | 1 | Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' %% says %% Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . `` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
say.v | 1 | The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months . In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year . `` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman %% said %% . The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company . Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses .
say.v | 1 | Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They %% said %% the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .
say.v | 1 | One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . In addition , both administration and congressional officials %% said %% the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups .
say.v | 1 | Sir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed . B.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares . Dealers %% said %% it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week . In other active shares , Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading , while Hillsdown Holdings , a food products concern , was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases . Elsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan .
say.v | 1 | That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University %% said %% they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year . Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . `` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
say.v | 1 | Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he %% said %% . Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years .
say.v | 1 | The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago . This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 . Mr. Dillow %% said %% the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises . Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''
say.v | 1 | HHS OFFICIALS expect Secretary Sullivan to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue . Before he was confirmed , Sullivan said he had `` reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research . '' But now , an official %% says %% , he is `` surrounded by right-to-lifers , '' who contend that any breakthroughs in fetal-tissue research could increase the demand for abortions . COOPERATION WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe . Britain , France and Italy pull out of a proposal to build new NATO frigates ; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects .

They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett %% said %% , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .

Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio . `` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she %% says %% , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent , Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter . `` People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue . Now it has -- especially for people my age . ''
say.v | 1 | Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head . He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park . Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to %% say %% whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office . `` I do n't think we do now , '' he says . `` I think we did .

say.v | 1 | Somewhere , the son sighs , things went terribly wrong with apartheid ; today , whites even rely on blacks to police their separation . `` People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it . But my father meant it to mean real separation , '' %% says %% the son . The Orange Workers speak sincerely . `` We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong , '' says Pieter Bruwer , the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer .

And deposits at NCNB Texas National Bank , a unit of NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , have increased $ 2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to Texas . `` Obviously , pride sells in Texas , '' %% says %% a spokeswoman for Bozell Inc. , Omaha , Neb. , which represents The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` Texasness , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more Texan than Texans .

say.v | 1 | One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He %% said %% , while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .

say.v | 1 | Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued the com - pany in 1981 after installing Burlington carpets in their office . The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick . As a result of their illness , the Beebes %% said %% , they lost $ 1.8 million in wages and earnings . In addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances . The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome .
say.v | 1 | All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project 's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage . The two that remain have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage .

say.v | 1 | The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials . `` We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , '' says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner . For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner %% says %% . `` In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters . The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you . ''
say.v | 1 | Unlikely as it may seem , tiny , politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy . And as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit . `` Irish and Soviet people are similar , '' %% says %% Mr. Ovcharenko . `` They look the same . They 're very friendly . ''
say.v | 1 | South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers agreed to suspend the strike by diamond workers and resume negotiations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. over their wage dispute , De Beers said . It also said the union had agreed to meet the company for further talks tomorrow . The strike at five De Beers mines began last Thursday , with 9,500 out of a total 10,000 NUM members employed on De Beers mines participating , according to the union , while De Beers %% said %% there were 7,800 participants . The union has demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage while De Beers 's final offer was an increase of 17 % . A 35-nation environmental conference opened in Sofia , Bulgaria .
say.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and %% said %% , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
see.v | 1 | The tumor , he suggested , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged . But there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson 's `` two-hit '' theory . Back then , scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could %% see %% the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible . Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease .
see.v | 1 | Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. Zaves gave up on long-term forecasts . And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds W. Henson Moore , U.S. deputy secretary of energy . `` I do n't %% see %% anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price . '' The catalyst for all this has been OPEC . About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession .
see.v | 6 | Mr. Fedders is philosophical about his travails . `` This whole experience has been an opportunity for internal growth , '' he says . He %% sees %% a psychoanalyst five mornings a week . `` I 've surrendered to the circumstances , '' Mr. Fedders says . `` The word surrender has a precise psychoanalytic meaning .
see.v | 1 | Viewers may not be cheering , either . Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials . At the same time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay-cable , where half the nation 's TV homes ca n't %% see %% them . CBS has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ? Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over .
see.v | 3 | One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market . Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign . This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who %% see %% higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents . He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3 million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985 .
see.v | 1 | `` The Famous Teddy Z , '' which CBS Inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged . Although the half-hour situation comedy %% seen %% Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce `` Teddy Z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which became the first network show to be canceled this season . `` Teddy Z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a Hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` Murphy Brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen . `` Teddy Z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with K mart Corp .
see.v | 3 | Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait . Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one . Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be %% seen %% in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala . When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . New York City :
see.v | 2 | `` It also means if you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going . '' Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline . Such steep drops in a category %% seen %% as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year . Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector .
see.v | 2 | Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . Conference participants %% saw %% these effects as flowing directly from ( a ) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; ( b ) planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and ( c ) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
see.v | 2 | The economic loss , jobs lost , anguish , frustration and humiliation are beyond measure . And most of these are absolutely unnecessary . Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one %% sees %% just about all of them could have been avoided . An accountant did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . `` I guess I was naive , '' he said .
see.v | 1 | Residents of this city soon will be %% seeing %% ads urging them to visit `` Cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- Lake View Cemetery . Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times . So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign .
see.v | 3 | China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year , a Western government report says , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit . According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace %% seen %% in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 . A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports . The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much .
see.v | 3 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to %% see %% defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
see.v | 2 | Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous . `` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works . It is easy to %% see %% why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage . Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject . Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
see.v | 2 | `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't %% see %% a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
see.v | 3 | Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . Every issue is multisided . This film attempts to show a side rarely %% seen %% in our media . Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only . Salaam .
see.v | 1 | So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market . Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative . Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade ( %% see %% accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 ) . Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment .
see.v | 3 | Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . `` But we certainly like what we 've %% seen %% so far . '' But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
see.v | 3 | Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post . BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics . Despite %% seeing %% his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation . Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir , for backing down on the elections , and at Shamir 's rival , Peres , for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker 's plan . Meanwhile , some U.S. officials fear PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
see.v | 3 | But do n't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket . Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5 % this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year 's 4.1 % rise . Next year may %% see %% a drop of one percentage point . Beef prices , hovering near records since the drought , could drop in earnest this winter if ranchers expand herds . Lower feed prices may help animals eat more cheaply , but humans have to factor in an expensive middleman : the processor .
set.v | 6 | Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing . He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in %% setting %% off the cancer . But he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared . Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer .
set.v | 6 | But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling . They believe the media , including `` Batibot , '' have played a crucial role . According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva , `` Batibot '' does n't %% set %% out to advance the cause of Filipino . `` It 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` We 're just using it . '' These days , `` Batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment .
set.v | 4 | `` It has never been interested in what we think . The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors , '' he added . Small investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said Thomas O'Hara , chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange 's Individual Investors Advisory Committee %% set %% up after the 1987 crash . `` The impression I 've got is they 'd love to do away with it { program trading } , but they { the exchange } ca n't do it , '' he said . Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading .
set.v | 4 | The state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis . To raise more highway funds , a measure to double the state 's nine-cent a gallon tax over five years is %% set %% to appear on the state 's June election ballot . But some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure . Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs .
set.v | 3 | The state attorney general 's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms , charging them with responsibility for much of a $ 200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer 's office in 1987 . The suit %% sets %% the firms ' liability at more than $ 185 million . The firms are Morgan Stanley & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , County Natwest Government Securities Inc. , Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman , Sachs & Co . The firms have all said that West Virginia 's suit is without merit .
set.v | 4 | PAY FOR PERFORMANCE hangs mostly on boss 's subjective view . Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity . Many companies have %% set %% up machinery to assure workers a fair shake . At most firms , though , it 's the immediate supervisor who decides the merit increases subordinates will be paid . Managers have `` some very broad discretion , '' says an official at Walt Disney Co .
set.v | 5 | In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer . Take Cleveland . It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk %% set %% his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
set.v | 3 | When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads . The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity . But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate %% set %% by Congress ? For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ? What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ?
set.v | 6 | Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami . `` These guys prey on human frailties . '' While the promises of big profits ought to %% set %% off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
set.v | 1 | `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that %% sets %% him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev .
set.v | 3 | My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner 's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner 's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern %% set %% by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .
set.v | 4 | Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion . This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy . So when textbooks , like that of Baker %% set %% out drawings of the ' Ptolemaic System ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically . It is the chief merit in Copernicus ' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent . He can not , e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth 's own motion .
set.v | 4 | And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to %% set %% up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations . We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .
set.v | 6 | The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve . It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions . It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will %% set %% off a kaleidescope of visual designs . Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content '' . Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
set.v | 4 | The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush . Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew . Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes , %% setting %% up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol . Warren eased his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an A[fj] . This he placed within quick reach .
set.v | 1 | `` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook . Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier '' ? ? A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been %% set %% out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous . Where was Mr. Flannagan , he wondered . Travelling home on a late train ? ?
set.v | 4 | Your wife 's in terrible shape '' . `` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly . Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and %% set %% the table . When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl . He said , `` I 've got some supper ready '' .
set.v | 3 | `` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive . Make it come off all right . Let me %% set %% the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive . And make my life different and better from this time on . Amen '' .

Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon 's and his father 's wagon . Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .
set.v | 5 | They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way . She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater . Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost %% set %% her bedspread on fire . She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it . Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .
set.v | 4 | You should n't be up , should you '' ? ? `` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie . I 'm all %% set %% . Just about to call a taxi '' . She was wearing some sort of gray blazer .
set.v | 6 | Above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . You have unwittingly %% set %% in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . Quite candidly , fellows , I would n't be in your shoes for all the rice in China . As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .
share.n | 2 | The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period , including $ 11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama . In the 1989 period also , interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago . In the first nine months , profit rose 10 % to $ 313.2 million , or $ 3.89 a %% share %% , from $ 283.9 million , or $ 3.53 a share . Sales rose 6.7 % to $ 4.27 billion from $ 4 billion .

share.n | 2 | These days Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust . Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ( $ 868 million ) in the fiscal year ended last March 31 , a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier , when the company lost money on operations . Nissan has increased earnings more than market %% share %% by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales . But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year , a modest increase of 4.7 % . The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota .
share.n | 2 | FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL Corp. declared a special dividend of one %% share %% of Class B common stock for each share of Class A common stock , payable to holders of record on Nov. 10 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves this as the effective date of the registration statement . Shareholders of the Santa Ana , Calif. , title-insurance company approved the creation of this second class of stock , which will be traded on the national over-the-counter market and which the company said would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes .
share.n | 2 | The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about 10.2 million . Separately , UniFirst reported that net income rose 21 % to $ 3 million , or 29 cents a share adjusted for the split , for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 26 . A year earlier UniFirst earned $ 2.4 million , or 24 cents a %% share %% adjusted for the split . Sales rose to $ 52.4 million from $ 50.1 million .
share.n | 2 | Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder . Giovanni Agnelli , a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat 's Agnelli family , owns approximately 75 % of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale , which in turn owns approximately 40 % of Fiat , Italy 's biggest private-sector industrial group . The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary %% shares %% in the limited partnership , which will give her control of 4.67 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co . The Aga Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for 7.45 % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital . His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies .
share.n | 1 | That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . In Singapore , per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. . And combining Fraser & Neave 's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the %% share %% of the soda market there , Coke said . Fraser & Neave , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei , where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in Singapore . Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets .
share.n | 2 | At the close , the narrower 30-share index was up 19.7 points to 1721.4 . Volume totaled a modest 334.5 million shares , up from 257.8 million shares Monday . The market also moved at early afternoon on news that Jaguar %% shares %% were being temporarily suspended at 746 pence ( $ 11.80 ) each . Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar , the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor . The golden share dates from Jaguar 's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover .
share.n | 2 | Contributing to the market 's reserved stance was the release later in the day of new data on the health of the U.S. economy , in the form of the U.S. index of leading indicators . Additionally , the end of the month position-squaring might have also played a minor role , traders said . Elsewhere , %% share %% prices closed higher in Amsterdam , Brussels , Milan and Paris . Prices were mixed in Zurich and lower in Stockholm . Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong , Manila , Singapore , Sydney and Wellington , but were lower in Seoul .
share.n | 2 | Jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange .

Until recently , Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50 % %% share %% of market , measured in dollar volume . Although he called current market conditions `` highly competitive , '' Mr. LaMothe , Kellogg 's chairman and chief executive officer , forecast an earnings increase for the full year .

share.n | 2 | It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level . The Fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks .

The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices .

share.n | 2 | `` I really do n't see the government doing something that Jaguar does n't want over the next 14 months , '' said Kenneth Warren , a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain 's House of Commons . `` The golden share is a single share , but it is the magic share . '' The government retained the single %% share %% after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization . The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor , British or foreign . Ford is willing to bid for 100 % of Jaguar 's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely .
share.n | 2 | Trinova Corp. said it will resume buying back as many as three million of its common %% shares %% under a program announced two years ago .

In the latest nine months , Ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a %% share %% , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a share .

share.n | 2 | Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid . Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said that is considered likely . Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's %% shares %% . Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % . The petition is still pending , but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas .

'' Last April , Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2 % of Cineplex for C$ 17.50 a share from Bronfman associates . Mr. Drabinsky , who would have had the right to vote those %% shares %% for two years , said the purchase , subsequently rejected by regulators , was aimed at consolidating his control of the company .

share.n | 2 | Still , Steve Cohen , an analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc. , said , `` I do n't see that this will be sufficient to give IBM a significant kick in the fourth quarter .

Some analysts have estimated IBM 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall 10 % to $ 3.57 a %% share %% from $ 3.97 a share a year earlier . In addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , IBM announced a magnetic-tape system for data storage that it said occupies half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single cartridge .

share.n | 2 | `` We anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories , '' said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams . He noted , however , that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations . Armco , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 39 cents a %% share %% in the year-ago quarter . Sales dropped to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million , because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division , which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp . Along with reduced volume , analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped .
share.n | 2 | The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned . Mr. Icahn has long believed , associates say , that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled $ 16.88 billion , is worth $ 70 a share if broken up . The stock closed yesterday at $ 33.625 , giving Mr. Icahn 's 33.6 million %% shares %% a value of $ 1.13 billion . Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and Mr. Corry does n't necessarily disagree . Unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as America 's backbone , Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say .
share.n | 2 | Shortly before that , USAir had said its third-quarter results would be `` significantly lower '' than a year earlier .

share.n | 2 | Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization , domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen . Investors expect these shares will be targets of investment trust funds , which often buy small amounts spread across a wide range of issues . On the other hand , high-priced %% shares %% such as Pioneer Electronic and Sony failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds , observers said . Tuesday 's notable losers were highpriced shares such as Pioneer , which shed 210 yen to 5,900 yen . Sony was down 130 to 8,590 .
share.n | 2 | The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $ 10 a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents a share placed in escrow .

Added Mr. Jacobson , `` There were some pretty bad losses in the stock . '' Big Board traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $ 150 a %% share %% entered by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which was active in UAL stock all day , is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon . A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday 's close . Both Jacobson traders , who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal , read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning .
share.n | 2 | HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14 % to $ 23.9 million , or $ 1.10 per fully diluted share , from $ 27.9 million , or $ 1.21 a fully diluted %% share %% , because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property . The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed 's stock , which lost 8.6 % of its value , closing at $ 38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , down $ 3.625 . HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market .

Dun & Bradstreet 's stock price began its recent spiral downward last Wednesday , when the company reported third-quarter results . Net income rose to 83 cents a share from 72 cents a %% share %% the year-earlier period . But analysts focused more on the drop in revenue , to $ 1.04 billion from $ 1.07 billion , reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of the controversial credit-reporting services . Last Thursday , Merrill Lynch securities analyst Peter Falco downgraded his investment rating on the firm , according to Dow Jones Professional Investors Report , citing a slowdown in the credit-reporting business .
share.n | 2 | John J. Crabb sold 4,500 shares for $ 11.13 each , leaving himself with a stake of 500 shares . He received $ 50,085 .

share.n | 2 | There are drawbacks . Vincent Tolentino , a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama , says of the recently ended Tokyo festival : `` No one makes deals ... and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals . '' Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy %% shares %% or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs ( about $ 2.60 ) for each transaction , bringing the total fee to 200 francs . While no figures exist , it is thought that many small investors in Belgium store securities privately , in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes . The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks , who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors .
share.n | 2 | A Manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes . But he said they are `` to a large degree , housekeeping , '' although some may generate some disagreement .

share.n | 2 | The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares , up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987 . The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2 % decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3 % rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September-October period . Generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed %% shares %% that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold . Short interest , which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold , but not yet replaced , can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks . Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues , short interest rose to 196.8 million shares , from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September .
share.n | 2 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago .

share.n | 2 | Last year 's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases , boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils , analysts said . For fiscal 1990 , analysts expect P&G 's sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % . Lynne Hyman , vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp. , expects P&G to post net of about $ 4.20 a %% share %% , on a post-split basis . `` But I 'm recognizing there 's a good chance they 'll do a bit better than that , '' she says . In fiscal 1989 , P&G earned $ 3.56 a share , adjusted for the stock split .
share.n | 2 | Wall Street securities giant Salomon Inc. posted a big , unexpected earnings gain in the third quarter , buoyed by its securities trading and investment banking activities .

Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion . On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier .

share.n | 2 | The Arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state . Higher earnings helped some issues . Amgen rose 2 1\/4 to 54 3\/4 on almost 800,000 %% shares %% , and CVB Financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares .
share.n | 2 | Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million .

share.n | 2 | The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when . The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company 's %% shares %% without permission until Dec. 31 , But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner .

share.n | 2 | Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction . The board 's decision , announced after the market closed Monday , initially prompted a severe sell-off in UAL shares , which at midday traded as low as $ 145 a share , down $ 33 a %% share %% , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock traders , who by then had seen UAL stock tumble 49 % since Oct. 12 , also triggered a marketwide sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 80 points at 10:40 a.m . But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market .
share.n | 2 | That gives them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose . However , a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday . The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ 225 and $ 240 a %% share %% , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . One person familiar with UAL said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month . Even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't quarrel with the board 's logic .

The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income .

share.n | 2 | The electronics , automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ 60 million , or 98 cents a share , down from $ 68 million , or $ 1.11 a share , a year earlier . Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis , by company tradition . Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a %% share %% for recall of faulty truck steering systems . The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs . Sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ 1.79 billion , from $ 1.65 billion , with all three major product groups reporting gains .

In the previous year , it had a loss of $ 22.5 million , or $ 6.52 a share , on revenue of $ 41.1 million . Although it is having serious cash-flow problems , Bay said the fair-market value of its holdings , minus debt , was equal to $ 6.02 a %% share %% at June 30 based on a recent appraisal . Book value per share , which is based on investments at cost , was a negative $ 6.69 a share . A year earlier , fair-market value per share was $ 26.02 and book value was $ 9.43 a share .

Goldman , Sachs & Co. will manage the offering . Macmillan said Berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock .
share.n | 2 | The sales force is viewed as a critical asset in Integrated 's attempt to sell its core companies . Whitehall cited concerns about how long Integrated would be able to hold together the sales force as one reason its talks with Integrated failed . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Integrated closed at $ 1.25 a %% share %% , down 25 cents . Integrated has been struggling to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing since June , when it failed to make interest payments on nearly $ 1 billion of debt . Integrated senior and junior creditors are owed a total of about $ 1.8 billion .
share.n | 2 | In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares . AMR was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 . Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a %% share %% , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 . Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees . However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .

source.n | 4 | This bias is in no way deliberate . The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data . The first of three major %% sources %% of error is the use of labor input estimates ( mainly employment or hours ) instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data . This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor . In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .

Military buyers have shown interest , National says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation .

source.n | 3 | In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to . One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . But a congressional %% source %% close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S. . Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama . One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .

In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management , Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a %% source %% of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance .

But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed . Some of our %% sources %% in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader , Pol Pot , has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border . So it 's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh .

Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said . The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated .

I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball . He %% started %% to run but Oso 's shot caught him on the wing . He jerked once in the grass and lay still . `` If you 're goin ' to kill 'em -- ! ! Kill 'em '' ! ! Oso growled .
start.v | 2 | But then , he had n't studied very hard . Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking . He put down his pipe and %% started %% to type . `` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' . He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College .
start.v | 2 | He had to go into the water . He 'd tell Sabella about the nightmare . It had %% started %% two years ago when he was in an iron lung . What caused it , he did n't know . The metal collar gagging his neck ? ?
start.v | 2 | No . I 'm not saying it right . What I meant to say was that I started to %% start %% in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband . How about them , I thought .
start.v | 2 | `` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? ? Forty years ago an English writer , W.L. George , dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for Merry England ' would not %% start %% a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead ' '' ! ! `` There was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage . It is n't what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy .
state.n | 2 | States are following suit . California enacted a rights law in 1988 . In 1989 , Illinois , Kansas , Ohio , Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws , the Federation of Tax Administrators , a %% state %% officials ' group , reports ; the features vary . And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states . One group is the Committee on State Taxation , which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce .
state.n | 2 | Ashurst is new to the Far East . Sidley will maintain its association with the Hashidate Law Office in Tokyo . THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union 's claim that the %% state %% of Michigan engages in wage-discrimination against female employees . A three-judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday . The UAW is seeking a hearing by the full 14-judge panel .
state.n | 2 | One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all . The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , vehemently denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . '' He blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by %% state %% investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them . `` I do n't know whose toes I 've stepped on , '' says the judge . `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . ''
state.n | 2 | `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County . The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987 , after the %% state %% attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County . The inquiry soon focused on the judge . Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
state.n | 1 | Of the agency 's 2,750 staff members , 230 are in the field working on actual projects , such as literacy and oceanographic research . The position of the United States , which once contributed 25 % of the budget , is that nothing has changed . John Bolton , the assistant secretary of %% state %% for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` statist , restrictive , nondemocratic '' programs make rejoining any time soon `` extremely unlikely . '' This has n't much bothered the UNESCO delegates , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns . Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time justifying continued membership .
state.n | 2 | Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a %% state %% imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years . So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait .
state.n | 2 | The current dispute involves allegations that Charlotte , N.C.-based First Union has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act . During the summer , Legal Services Corp. , a Florida legal aid group , filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties . The petition challenged First Union 's lending record in the %% state %% , saying that the bank-holding company had `` shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state . '' In deferring action on the merger , the Fed said , `` The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow { it } to reach a final conclusion on First Union 's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina , including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities . '' The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union 's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks .
state.n | 2 | The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination . The suit , assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of ( New York 's ) unlawful employment practices . '' Justice Rubin , a %% state %% judge since 1969 , said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . `` The issue is n't age -- age is just a number . The issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench , '' Justice Rubin said .
state.n | 3 | `` It 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , '' says Bert Vogelstein , a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer . `` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level . Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly %% state %% . '' Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check .
state.n | 2 | But in its ruling last April , the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined . Each company 's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market . The New York court also upheld a %% state %% law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits . The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension . ( Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue ; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz , and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz )
state.n | 2 | Its problem , they say , is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt load is keeping Revco in the red . `` If bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said Jeffrey Stein , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland . In addition , Revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 %% states %% represent a lot of real estate , he said , and demographics are helping pharmacies : The nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs . Last week , Revco 's parent company , Anac Holding Corp. , said the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter , compared with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter . Sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4 % from the previous year .
state.n | 2 | `` How do you prove a negative ? '' Since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , Mr. Boyd explains . At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular %% states %% have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks , and against black defendants compared with white defendants . Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence . The Kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the Supreme Court ruling .
state.n | 2 | It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number . Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off . Economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced %% state %% spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado . Analysts also say it 's inevitable that Brazil will seek to renegotiate its $ 115 billion foreign debt , on which it suspended interest payments last month . Analysts say , however , that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for instance by subsidizing staple food items .
state.n | 2 | Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a %% state %% run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
state.n | 2 | The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits , an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems . But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea , included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients . But first on the list of priorities , says the National Federation of Independent Business , is to prohibit %% state %% laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items , such as psychiatric care , in basic health plans . Such requirements , they argue , make it difficult to provide a basic , low-cost health-benefits package . `` Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered , there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state ; now there are 400 , '' says Carolyn Miller , an NFIB lobbyist .
state.n | 2 | The result is that instead of the Pentagon 's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases , the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30 . The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees ; meanwhile , lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states . House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten ( D. , Miss . ) helped secure $ 49.7 million for his %% state %% , or more than double the Pentagon 's budget . West Virginia , home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd , would receive $ 21.5 million -- four times the military 's request . Tennessee and North Carolina , home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees , receive $ 243.2 million , or 25 % above the Pentagon 's request .
state.n | 2 | How quickly things change . This past summer , investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable . Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices , making %% state %% and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period . But while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value , you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings . Bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
state.n | 2 | His attorney could n't be reached for comment . PRO BONO VOLUNTARISM : In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in New York state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year , the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs . The %% state %% bar association 's policy making body , the House of Delegate , voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar 's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono . `` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester , who headed the bar 's pro bono study committee . DALLAS AND HOUSTON law firms merge : Jackson & Walker , a 130-lawyer firm in Dallas and Datson & Scofield , a 70-lawyer firm in Houston said they have agreed in principle to merge .
state.n | 1 | All the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency , even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built . Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits . %% State %% loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy . However , some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway 's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago . In that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees .
state.n | 2 | Mr. Dinkins also has failed to allay Jewish voters ' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has . These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before . A former U.S. Marine , Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel , Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton , and getting himself elected to the %% state %% assembly in 1965 . But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame , a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton , was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running . `` I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow , '' he said at the time .
state.n | 2 | The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom . The charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure . The judge handling the case in %% state %% Supreme Court , a trial court , had tossed out the jury verdicts , ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules . But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that federal law did n't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution . Elizabeth Holtzman , district attorney for Brooklyn , N.Y. , said , `` The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker-safety laws , state prosecutors have the power to protect working people . ''
state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
state.n | 2 | Last month , Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press , the commissioner said . The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August . The amount covers taxes , interest and penalties owed from 1966 , when the %% state %% began collecting corporate taxes , to 1985 . Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988 , Mr. Kidder added . Under Massachusetts tax laws , corporations must pay 9.5 % of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities , including warranties , customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships .
state.n | 3 | Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case . They speak volumes about the %% state %% of our society at a given moment . It has always been so . In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature .
state.n | 2 | Dictaphone Corp. says there 's a big business demand for its voice-activated taping systems , whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 and can record 240 conversations simultaneously , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 . Businesses `` want to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says John Hiltunen , Dictaphone 's manager of media relations . The %% state %% of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system , he says , `` to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . '' Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say they use voice-activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders . Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years .
state.n | 2 | The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $ 5.2 billion . Axa has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir James 's investment vehicle , Hoylake Investments Ltd. , for $ 4.5 billion plus a $ 1 billion investment in Hoylake . Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine %% states %% where Farmers operates , and Mr. Bebear 's trip will take him to Idaho , Arizona and New York after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . Hearings on Axa 's acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in Idaho ; Nov. 20 in Illinois ; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona ; Dec. 11 in Washington state ; and Jan. 8 in Oregon . Hearings have n't yet been set in Texas , Ohio and Kansas .
state.n | 2 | Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5 % and 7.5 % of Impco 's total operating expenses . Eastern Reproduction Corp. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says Robert Maguire , president . One %% state %% environmental regulator returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. Maguire says . WITHHOLDING RULES : Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $ 3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small businesses .
state.n | 2 | Willie Brown , speaker of California 's Assembly , said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks . California 's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency . Both Mr. Brown , the %% state %% 's most influential legislator , and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government . According to a spokesman , the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes . Mr. Brown , meanwhile , believes `` only one tax will be feasible , and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said Chuck Dalldorf , an aide .
state.n | 2 | `` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said Kirk West , president of the California Chamber of Commerce . But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief tab . Since the late 1970s , California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a %% state %% ballot initiative known as Proposition 13 . The state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis .
state.n | 2 | Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs . `` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said Quentin Kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee . Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the %% state %% over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .

Yet their best boast is that they produce 32 % of Polish pork . `` I 've heard from friends that %% state %% farms are subsidized , '' Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife , Wieslawa , sets some chairs out in the sun . `` We have one near here . There is a lot of waste .
state.n | 1 | `` Solidarity does n't care for the good of this region , '' he says after a few pleasantries . `` They want to turn everything upside down in a week .

state.n | 2 | When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . New York City : Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern %% states %% . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .
state.n | 2 | A spokesman says the governor believes he can avoid increases by relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs . Still , Hugo 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local governments authority to levy sales taxes . A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says Hugo has n't prompted proposals for %% state %% or local increases . California , where earthquake damage may top $ 5 billion , plans a special legislative session . Property-tax relief is likely .
state.n | 2 | At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 %% states %% and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
state.n | 2 | It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the %% states %% . But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
state.n | 2 | That total would be important for Drexel . The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 %% states %% reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .
state.n | 2 | The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license . The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser . State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , %% state %% securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed ( Drexel ) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
state.n | 2 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the %% states %% than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .

East Bloc pollution data typically have been %% state %% secrets . While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information . For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose .
state.n | 2 | NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business . In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business . But in Washington %% state %% , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on children 's programs by $ 360 million , fearing the state 's 7.8 % sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays . DIALING DOLLARS : Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers .
state.n | 2 | `` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors { primarily to greater speed } , '' according to NHTSA . The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 . In %% states %% that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 . In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year , the same as in 1986 .

That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines . Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the %% state %% . The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps.

state.n | 2 | Exxon Corp. filed suit against the %% state %% of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill . The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies . The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
state.n | 2 | Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue . The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' Since the spill last March , Exxon and the %% state %% have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .
state.n | 3 | Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm . Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago . Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's %% state %% of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . '' Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .

Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states .
state.n | 2 | Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back . However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions . Many %% states %% already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities . These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
state.n | 2 | Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that %% state %% . Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed . Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin .
state.n | 2 | Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for %% state %% unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .
state.n | 2 | Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them . William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed . The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. , have filed suit in Georgia %% state %% court against Stuart James , alleging fraud . They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding . They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently .
state.n | 2 | Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the %% state %% , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .

state.n | 2 | It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the %% state %% is so heavily represented in it ? ( True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . ) Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 { state enterprises } currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .
state.n | 2 | In an unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances . The bill does n't include an estimated $ 1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the House . But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for %% state %% governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency .
state.n | 2 | An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) . Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe . Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the %% state %% government level as it does at the federal level . State government is more typically split along Republican-governor\/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse . A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .

'' Mr. Bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease Washington 's problem . But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that %% state %% . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .

Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit 's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co . The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following %% states %% : New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Wisconsin , Arizona and Montana . The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985 . John Christie , a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of `` second-guessing '' state-level regulations , with which , he said , his clients had complied .
state.n | 2 | Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California 's Department of Transportation , employees familiar with the project say . The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings . %% State %% engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse . The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared . Sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days .

Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ; B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block ; Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block . Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance . Stores in a %% state %% of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. , May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. , which should do well . `` There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers , '' says Cynthia Turk , a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant . Says Mr. Steidtmann : `` I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas . ''
state.n | 2 | `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax %% states %% , such as New York or California . But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
state.n | 2 | Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising . %% State %% laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court . It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
state.n | 2 | In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase %% state %% revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .

The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem . Moreover , %% state %% officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area 's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours .

state.n | 2 | `` But it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri , where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . '' The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens . As a result , GOP %% state %% Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place . The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother . Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .
state.n | 2 | At the same time , abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy , deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan , the National Right to Life Committee 's director of state organizational development , calls `` reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support . '' These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion . `` Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves ` pro-choice ' rather than ` pro-abortion , ' '' says Mary Spaulding , the group 's associate %% state %% legislative coordinator . Over the weekend , the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians , including Pennsylvania 's Mr. Freind , as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques , including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures . `` We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time , '' says Kate Michelman , executive director of the group .

Heileman Brewing Co. , a La Crosse , Wis. , unit of Bond Corp . As the ad 's tone implies , the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days , and Lone Star is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that . From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the %% state %% has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders . While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times . That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .

Revenue is estimated at $ 18.6 million . The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of %% state %% uniform commercial code division . FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute . The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet system installed earlier this year .

state.n | 2 | The account currently has $ 220 million . And though federal law dictates that only $ 100 million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster , administration officials expect Congress to move in to authorize spending more now in California . To get that money , %% states %% must go through an elaborate approval process , but officials expect red tape to be cut this time . Keith Mulrooney , special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson , also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California , the state set tougher standards for bridges , and with federal aid , began a program to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards . The first phase of the program has been completed , but two other phases are continuing .

state.n | 2 | Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside . But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below . Officials of the %% state %% agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up . Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $ 55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake . Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work .

The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing\/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T . Using Gnu-Emacs , the spy could substitute a bogus `` atrun '' program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix %% system %% every five minutes . Once his cuckoo 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` super-user , '' with access to everything .

The company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the Unix operating %% system %% . That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines . In addition , Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .

system.n | 1 | The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation : tax rate , times inflation rate , times basis for the gain . Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation , indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6 % rate without indexation . But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax `` payments '' on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law , even though the tax `` rate '' is the same under both %% systems %% . As you can see , the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary , but permanent . I hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and , in my view , most beneficial feature -- indexation .

Investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again . ''
system.n | 1 | But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress . Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets . He argued that the current circuit-breaker %% system %% allows investors to know `` precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last . '' Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill . One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies .
system.n | 2 | Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its %% system %% in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings . Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and Toyota 's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring . But drivers in the U.S. must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .
system.n | 2 | In a statement , Scott McNealy , Sun 's chief executive officer , said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April . One of those new computers , called Sparcstation 1 , accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter , he said . More than two-thirds of the %% systems %% shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in April . But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer . These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $ 20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30 .

IBM 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year , with analysts estimating they have risen 10 % to 12 % . `` Demand for these %% systems %% has been very , very strong , '' said Bill Grabe , a senior IBM marketing executive . `` We have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without '' the systems that were announced yesterday . But the 3090 line is nearly five years old -- which is getting up there in mainframe years -- and its growth is expected to slow in 1990 .

system.n | 1 | Here , the experience of New York City is decisive . Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians . New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this %% system %% of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it . -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
system.n | 2 | What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year . But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica . Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed %% systems %% , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping . Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available , why not use them ? Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs .

'' He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment %% systems %% as well as mergers and acquisitions . Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors .

The Tempe , Ariz. , maker of underground fuel-storage %% systems %% said the most recent period was affected by customers ' problems complying with recent Environmental Protection Agency regulations . For the nine months , the company expects to post a net loss of about $ 879,000 , or 35 cents to 40 cents a share , on revenue of $ 6.5 million .

system.n | 2 | New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV %% system %% . However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million . The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper .
system.n | 1 | And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made ( at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators ) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias 's agenda . Prior to this episode , Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn. ) , sensing an open field , undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels . Visiting Nicaragua , he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral %% system %% and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas . In Honduras , where the Contras are a hot political issue , he promised to help unblock some $ 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington . Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani ; Mr. Cristiani 's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd 's likes and dislikes .
system.n | 1 | The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury . BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking %% system %% , which is about 80 % state-controlled . In a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals .

Storage , Louisville , Colo. , which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers , said the huge increase in net reflects `` strong sales '' of its tape products , particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System , which holds a library of tape cartridges . The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge %% system %% , which cost $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 each . Quarter revenue was $ 232.6 million , up 12 % from $ 206 million last year .

FileNet said it does n't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract , but said it ca n't predict the outcome of the dispute . The disagreement centers on testing deadlines and other issues involving a FileNet %% system %% installed earlier this year . State officials could n't be reached for comment late yesterday . FileNet noted that it had cash and marketable securities totaling $ 22.5 million on Sept. 30 , and stockholders ' equity is $ 60.1 million .

The $ 1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons . If all goes well , it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 to pick up detailed data about gases that may be similar to the material from which the solar %% system %% was formed 4.6 billion years ago . Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape . Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth , but these planets are lifeless ; Earth , on the other hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life .

It was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp. , a San Antonio , Texas-based data-processing %% systems %% maker . Intelogic Trace , a computer services company , was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985 , after Mr. Edelman gained control . After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman , the corporate raider purchased 30 % of Datapoint 's shares .

The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA 's Space Physics Analysis Network , Mr. Redmond said . NASA said the Galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their %% systems %% to reject worms . But Mr. Redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . Michael Alexander , a senior editor at Computerworld , a trade publication , said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name .
system.n | 1 | Also , Mr. Savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . '' Jeffrey Nichols , president of APMS Canada , Toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal . `` Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the { Federal Reserve } in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial %% system %% , which helped the stock market rebound on Monday , '' he said . There is n't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold , he said . `` They still bear the memory of October 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' Mr. Nichols said .

turn.v | 2 | Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control %% turn %% malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .

'' The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab 's car division . Fiat 's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company , which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have %% turned %% down the offer . News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault .
turn.v | 11 | The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case , in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos , reports and documents . Last November , a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract . The company , for its part , maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that should n't be %% turned %% over to prosecutors . A hearing is scheduled on the issue today . The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts .
turn.v | 2 | Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa 's interior , then in the cold surf of the ocean , and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98 % of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality . While other mines might yield more carats , a higher percentage of them go to industrial use . Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault , it has been %% turned %% into one . Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908 , the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area , a designation normally reserved for military operations . When the Germans lost World War I , they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer , patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers .

'' That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) .
turn.v | 11 | And Friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment .

Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average . `` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. Brouwer .
turn.v | 4 | There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while %% turning %% away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .

turn.v | 1 | Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; ; the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet can not feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that %% turns %% a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the sum is nothing . And yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .

Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation . According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' .

She had begun to %% turn %% back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
turn.v | 1 | The air took on a special strength now that they 'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air . He %% turned %% from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak 's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended . Mark 's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . `` Remember the Starbird ? ? '' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .
turn.v | 1 | Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff . The man swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side . Watson %% turned %% away , sickened for the first time in many months . He heard the patient voice calling . -- Henry ? ?
turn.v | 5 | In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen . She was intimidated by the stove . He found the pilot light and %% turned %% on one of the burners for her . The gas flamed up two inches high . They found the teakettle .
turn.v | 1 | Only one worth a shit , and that 's Brandon . He ai n't so bad . His thoughts %% turned %% to other things . The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for . Kaboom for .
turn.v | 1 | The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife . Perhaps it was right ; ; perhaps it was just . He had dared to defy nature , to %% turn %% his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished . Like Mrs. Dalloway , with her regrets about Peter Walsh , he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent . If he had had a son , he would tell him , `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying '' .
turn.v | 1 | When he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on Shayol : `` Standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes . Good luck , fellow '' . Mercer %% turned %% away . The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat . What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol ? ?
turn.v | 1 | He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had n't meant what he had believed it had . He felt unutterably weary . Dean %% turned %% from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms . He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness . She too began to weep .
turn.v | 1 | The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family . The haughty white girl %% turned %% to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier . It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' . Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans ' most important and enlightened slave owners .
turn.v | 1 | `` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ? `` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said . Waddell %% turned %% to face him . `` No '' ? ? He asked . `` But that 's what he told me .
turn.v | 1 | Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man . Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey . It 's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman %% turn %% and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them . Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman 's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .
turn.v | 2 | Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones . The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake . Their world %% turned %% black . It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence . The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .
turn.v | 1 | Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host 's daughters . I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass . Then I saw the father 's head slightly %% turn %% ; ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold . Autos whizzed past . White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze .
turn.v | 12 | Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains . Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them . No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp %% turned %% in for a night of sound sleep . For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night . Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains .
turn.v | 6 | Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment . But that indictment was never made . For Tom Horn , it %% turned %% out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing . The former scout 's alibi could n't be shaken . The authorities had to release him .
turn.v | 1 | The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts . Five miles . In a small grove against the river they halted , %% turning %% deep into the protection of the trees . Foster had brought extra clothing also . A good man , Emmett .
turn.v | 1 | If you were a man '' -- `` She is n't , mister '' . The voice came from behind him , and Wilson %% turned %% . The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees . But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .
turn.v | 2 | When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures . `` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said . `` We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and %% turn %% the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that '' . `` What else '' ? ? `` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
turn.v | 1 | He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . I had %% turned %% at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .
turn.v | 6 | At least , we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was . I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . Especially in the way Gladdy had %% turned %% out . Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it was n't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . But I must n't start on Alice .
turn.v | 5 | He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to . Fearless . Every night when he wanted a drink of water , did n't he practice being fearless by not %% turning %% on the bathroom light ? ? A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he 'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I 'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad . He had n't intended to make the promise .
turn.v | 3 | And Early Spring seized the whip and said : `` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter . Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! ! But the old man %% turned %% on her , jerking the whip from her hand . `` Get into your hovel '' ! ! He spat . `` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
turn.v | 1 | The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee . Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal . She would %% turn %% to them , then turn to him , then turn again . Watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth . Signora Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest .
turn.v | 1 | No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . She haunted me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country . `` We all feel guilty '' , I %% turned %% away from her coldly . `` It was nobody 's fault . She overplayed her hand '' .
turn.v | 4 | They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' . I was amazed . You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to %% turn %% yourself out of your own home . You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal . And I was n't .
turn.v | 2 | Hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration . Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let 's resume our catalogue . Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to %% turn %% your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . The three Indian brass deities , though -- Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea .
turn.v | 2 | Perhaps that was the first thing to do . A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , %% turn %% into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .
value.n | 2 | The size of the issue was scaled back from an originally planned $ 350 million . The first part , consisting of $ 151 million of 13 3\/4 % senior subordinated reset notes , was priced at 99.75 . The rate on the notes will be reset annually to give the issue a market %% value %% of 101 . However , the maximum coupon at which the notes can be reset is 16 1\/4 % . The minimum coupon is 13 3\/4 % .
value.n | 2 | FOREIGN PRIME RATES : Canada 13.50 % ; Germany 9 % ; Japan 4.875 % ; Switzerland 8.50 % ; Britain 15 % . These rate indications are n't directly comparable ; lending practices vary widely by location . TREASURY BILLS : Results of the Monday , October 30 , 1989 , auction of short-term U.S. government bills , sold at a discount from face %% value %% in units of $ 10,000 to $ 1 million : 7.78 % 13 weeks ; 7.62 % 26 weeks .

value.n | 2 | Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton . LTV 's planned increase , which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers , does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate . LTV confirmed the price-increase plan , saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the %% value %% of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities . A spokesman for LTV Steel , which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp. , noted that steel prices , adjusted for inflation , increased only 1.7 % between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much . At the same time , steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive .
value.n | 2 | Santa Fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20 % interest in its real estate unit to the California Public Employees Retirement System for roughly $ 400 million . Since the real estate unit also includes debt , the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to $ 3 billion . `` The implied current net asset %% value %% of 22.70 { per share } is well below the 30 level that the Street believed , '' PaineWebber says . `` The upside was in the intangible real estate ... which is no longer an intangible . '' So what is Santa Fe worth ?
value.n | 2 | Florida National said yesterday that it remains committed to the merger . Dycom Industries gained 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 after it said it agreed to buy Ansco & Associates and two affiliates for cash and stock . The %% value %% of the transaction was n't disclosed . The companies being acquired provide telecommunications services to the telephone industry . Willamette Industries , whose stock has suffered steep losses in recent sessions , surged 1 1\/2 to 49 .
value.n | 2 | G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy . Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand . But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose %% value %% rises when interest rates decline . Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen . `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
value.n | 3 | That 's 115 % more than in 1981 . Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences . It reflects %% values %% of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says John H. Moxley III , who directs physician-executive searches for Korn\/Ferry International . `` This is a change in the social fabric of medicine , '' he says . Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills
value.n | 2 | McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause . Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices . To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term %% value %% of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer . `` We 're very pleased with the new deal . We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , which holds 500,000 LIN shares .
value.n | 2 | After days of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt 's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation . Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks . If the case is converted to Chapter 7 , what remains of the oil tycoon 's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a %% value %% of less than $ 125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service , whose claim for $ 300 million in back taxes has priority in the case . Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing , according to attorneys involved . While admitting such a move would be `` devastating '' to most creditors , Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form .
value.n | 1 | For instance , employment in Denver will be reduced to 105 from 430 . But on the West Coast , where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region , the Bakersfield , Calif. , office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305 . The reorganization will `` focus on the %% value %% and potential of assets , '' Mr. Spruell said .
value.n | 2 | Leaseway said it has begun discussions with certain institutional debt holders to review the proposed private placement transaction , which would exchange the debt for new subordinated debt instruments and equity securities . Specific terms are subject to review and a final agreement with debt holders , the company said . But the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face %% value %% and reduced cash interest . Also , debt holders would be offered an equity position in Leaseway , which in total would represent a controlling interest in the company . Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is the adviser on the transaction .
value.n | 2 | In March , American Medical received a $ 24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder M. Lee Pearce . It also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price . A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder %% value %% . The following month , the company put itself up for sale . It received more offers , but the auction was surprisingly won by IMA , which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. Gilleland to stay on as an equity participant .
value.n | 2 | `` We can lose money on this , '' he says . `` And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , '' says Mrs. Hammack , reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand . Earthquake insurance costs about $ 2 to $ 4 annually for every $ 1,000 of %% value %% , and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe . So , many Californians believe they can get by without it . Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption .
value.n | 2 | The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the %% value %% and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument . Scott Miller , an FASB project manager , said that a final rule will be issued before year end . But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months .
value.n | 2 | Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills . So why does Renaissance 's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28 , where it closed yesterday , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ? `` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better %% value %% all the time , '' Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said yesterday . Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8 % from about 9 % at the start of the year . Stock prices , meanwhile , are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9 .
value.n | 3 | There 's plenty of whimsy here , but it is n't always clear whether it 's intentional . The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility . But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a snail , '' they say , `` important %% values %% such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . '' Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low . Honda has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey , and a slightly larger cousin , the Gorilla .
value.n | 2 | The loss is a setback to IBM , which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration . That 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations . A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential %% value %% of the contract , which is still in negotiation . He said that American Telephone & Telegraph , MCI Communications Corp. , Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital 's subcontractors on the project . `` When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services , we wanted to get the best vendor for that service , '' said Paul Allen , the spokesman .
value.n | 2 | And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort . On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc . Nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional %% value %% . Mr. Pilson calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year . `` It 's too early to tell '' what happens after that , he says .
value.n | 2 | Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street . Traders said that Mr. Greenspan , whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets . Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee , Mr. Greenspan said the short-term %% value %% of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank . `` Our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' Mr. Greenspan said , referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy . In perhaps his most telling remark , Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5 % as `` much too high to be ignored . ''
value.n | 3 | Ms. Bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` South Pacific , '' is decidedly downtown . Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters , still hosting an annual `` A Christmas Carol . '' How would this bastion of traditional %% values %% fare in Ms. Bogart 's iconoclastic hands ? She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season . It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht 's theoretical writings , called `` No Plays , No Poetry . ''
value.n | 2 | Despite all these innovations , most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named `` bedrock sweepers '' who toil in the wake of the excavators . Laboring in blue and gray overalls , they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices , and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds . But should they spy one , the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its %% value %% . For these workers at the bottom of the mine 's pay scale , this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail . Still , employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two .
value.n | 2 | But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face %% value %% . The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
value.n | 2 | That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators . These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987 . In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual %% value %% of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) . World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998 . The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 .
value.n | 2 | Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . '' And much home-equity credit is used conservatively . `` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the %% value %% of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says . So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs ( see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 ) . A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
value.n | 2 | A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund . Also holding two seats each on the board , they said , would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada , and Itel Corp. , controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell . The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the %% value %% of their investments , including possible spinoffs . Itel bought a 17 % stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20 % stake ; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific . The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
value.n | 2 | But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential %% values %% for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection .
value.n | 2 | He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . '' `` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , '' says Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager . `` It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' %% value %% of the shares and their market value . '' So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded . `` The crime goes to character , '' says Ron Maiorana , a consultant to the Giuliani campaign .
value.n | 2 | The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. -- $ 475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures , due Oct. 15 , 2001 , priced at par to yield 14.75 % . The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market %% value %% of 101 . However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset can only be 15.5 % . Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock of CNW Holdings .
value.n | 2 | So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive . Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face %% value %% to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
value.n | 3 | `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist %% values %% , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
value.n | 2 | Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $ 75 million stock-for-debt exchange . The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal . As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year , the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $ 1,000 face %% value %% of debt . However , that figure could be revised , Financial Corp. said . Currently , the company has about six million common shares outstanding .
value.n | 1 | Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects . Now , says Mr. Biehl , value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble . '' To institutional investors or brokers , he adds , a company with %% value %% is a company at risk of being swallowed up . Ms. Bettner covers personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau .
value.n | 2 | LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire U.S. cellular interests in markets other than those in which McCaw holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless LIN has an interest there or contiguous to it . Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in LIN 's best interest . Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market %% value %% of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years . If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years , McCaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it , and the independent directors will run the bidding . The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .
value.n | 2 | Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field , Calif . Sterling , which estimated the %% value %% of the contract at $ 150 million , said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations . In 1988 , Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract , claiming it had submitted the lowest bid . As a result , last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract .
value.n | 2 | Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries . Tosco Corp. jumped $ 1.125 to $ 20.125 and Chevron Corp. , despite a temporary pipeline shutdown , rose $ 1 to $ 65 . Meanwhile , shares of some big housing lenders got hit , on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral -- people 's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in %% value %% . Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $ 81.50 , and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $ 31.875 . Some California thrift stocks also fell , including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. , which reported lower earnings yesterday .
value.n | 2 | According to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in Camden , N.J . In February 1987 , Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump 's 3.1 million Bally shares for $ 83.7 million -- more than $ 18 million above market price . The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market %% value %% to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer . Lawyers for shareholders , Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed . But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ 6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump , with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money .
value.n | 2 | The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman 's strategy had been abandoned . The stock market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock , discounted to present value . Why should it be so surprising that a 30 % cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the %% value %% of the nation 's capital stock ? The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ 15 trillion . The value traded on the exchanges is close to $ 3 trillion .
value.n | 2 | Mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated -- but only temporarily . Their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors . The shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic %% value %% of a freezer full of meat . In Texas after Hurricane Alicia , major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to Houston , no gouging , just good will . Tom Mongan
value.n | 2 | Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead , arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance . Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces . Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won 's %% value %% remains heavily controlled . Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved `` satisfactorily '' but gave no hint when that will happen . Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier , he said South Korea ca n't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues `` without causing political and social trauma .
value.n | 2 | Sales were $ 623 million , up 0.5 % from $ 619.8 million a year ago . Rohm & Haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense . The company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the %% value %% of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars . In addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter . Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay .
value.n | 2 | Although it is having serious cash-flow problems , Bay said the fair-market value of its holdings , minus debt , was equal to $ 6.02 a share at June 30 based on a recent appraisal . Book value per share , which is based on investments at cost , was a negative $ 6.69 a share . A year earlier , fair-market %% value %% per share was $ 26.02 and book value was $ 9.43 a share .
value.n | 2 | In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters . The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens . The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the `` book %% value %% of the collection { be } reduced to zero . '' In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : `` Govern yourself accordingly . ''
work.v | 1 | With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor . Mr. Luzon and his team , however , say they are n't interested in a merger . Instead , they are %% working %% to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992 . `` I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run , '' Mr. Luzon says . Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports .
work.v | 1 | Male scandal victims invariably fare better . Anne Burford , the former EPA chief who resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with Congress , was kayoed in the confrontation , even though she was never charged with official wrondgoing . She %% worked %% part-time as a consultant and wrote a book , but never restarted her high-powered legal career . It did n't help when , in 1986 , she was charged ( and then cleared ) on allegations of public drunkenness . `` I cut my losses and ran , '' she says , from her new home in Colorado , where she is busy remodeling .
work.v | 1 | State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them . Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed . The Communists spent 40 years %% working %% to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here . Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that Solidarity has barely started . But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already : the private farmer .
work.v | 1 | The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs %% works %% for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .
work.v | 2 | Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will %% work %% important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently .
work.v | 2 | But they think promotions are limited . THE HOUSE votes down a proposal to put pension plans under the control of joint labor-management boards . Some consultants had insisted it would n't %% work %% . LONG-TERM care insurance gains favor . More than half the people surveyed for the Employee Benefit Research Institute say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage .
work.v | 1 | Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once %% worked %% on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says . In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous .
work.v | 8 | More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending . The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries . Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it %% works %% out a plan for paying its debts . American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .
work.v | 1 | Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood . Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer . Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be %% working %% as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera . After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . '' But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
work.v | 2 | And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline . There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC . `` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything %% works %% for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director . Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel ( Far East ) Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar . These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
work.v | 8 | Mary Poulin Palo Alto , Calif. I suggest that The Wall Street Journal ( as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind ) should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists . Perhaps an arrangement could be %% worked %% out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories . Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support . Douglas B. Evans
work.v | 2 | But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it %% work %% , '' says Mr. Anderson . What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .
work.v | 1 | The market 's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash . It may also expedite the SEC 's modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury 's look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds . Brady and Breeden %% work %% well together on the plunge , despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden 's nomination to the SEC post . BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics . Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither , the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation .
work.v | 1 | The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll . Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA . Although %% working %% for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively . During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges .
work.v | 8 | As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength . No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction . Until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are %% worked %% out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions . America possesses an enormous defense power . It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .
work.v | 1 | In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some %% working %% for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one 's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .
work.v | 9 | The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious orgy . A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon . It began invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually %% worked %% up to high , shrill appeals to God and man . And then the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and then here in Alabama . With shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering , wailing , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force .
work.v | 1 | Her house stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below . Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity . Mrs. Balcolm %% worked %% for the brain . Mrs . Ten Eyke did mental health . Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind .
work.v | 1 | Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day . He tended the new colts Beau had sired . He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees %% working %% against the summer 's purple dusk . No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph . They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news .
work.v | 8 | Balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations . Therefore to Helva , the problem that she could n't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . She would %% work %% out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing . She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental . Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal .
work.v | 1 | You get ready '' He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air . Gavin 's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , %% working %% by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words . When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch . The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .
work.v | 8 | To his surprise his plan worked perfectly . `` All right , if you ca n't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling . `` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and %% work %% your problems '' . And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . He scarcely saw them .
work.v | 1 | It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him . For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $ 600 a man . ( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hands %% worked %% for $ 30 and found ) . Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark . ( A detailed search of old coroner 's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest ) .
work.v | 4 | She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . `` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said . He saw her hand start to %% work %% down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist . `` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor now . `` I 've had enough of that .
work.v | 4 | The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands . The snake %% worked %% away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods . The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target . I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .
work.v | 1 | And then there was Linda 's engagement to Bobbie Evans . There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie was n't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who %% worked %% for the same steel company as John did . Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . It was n't even John and Edythe .
work.v | 1 | The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton 's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he did n't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . It was an awkward hour , but I did n't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to %% work %% . It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us . In a way , Askington was right .
work.v | 1 | Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or Abe Spector , a process-server , we could n't determine which . His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott 's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . The grocery the youth %% worked %% for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .
work.v | 9 | Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . It almost always %% works %% out for the best . ) Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I can not say . With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse .
