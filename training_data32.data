affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
affect.v | 1 | Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to %% affect %% our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
allow.v | 1 | The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . But it would %% allow %% considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .

'' DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would %% allow %% it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
allow.v | 1 | I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , %% allow %% psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now .
announce.v | 1 | Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a Washington priority . `` The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada 's membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , '' said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. . The Canadian application is expected to be %% announced %% in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . `` Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , '' Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada 's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization .
announce.v | 1 | Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . Goodson also %% announced %% that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
announce.v | 1 | The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome . On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses . The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by %% announcing %% : `` Today I go see the horses '' . It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him . He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil .
approve.v | 1 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also %% approved %% was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
approve.v | 1 | Honecker 's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule . HUNGARY ADOPTED constitutional changes to form a democratic system . At a nationally televised legislative session in Budapest , the Parliament overwhelmingly %% approved %% changes formally ending one-party domination in the country , regulating free elections by next summer and establishing the office of state president to replace a 21-member council . The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary . Like other Soviet bloc nations , it had been known as a `` people 's republic '' since
area.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade %% areas %% , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
area.n | 1 | Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports . The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s , however , forcing the bank to face competition . At the same time , many of Spain 's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing %% areas %% faced a sharp decline in economic growth . As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .

European venture capital funds total about $ 14 billion and are expected to continue growing 35 % annually . Continentals believe that the strongest growth %% area %% will be southern Europe . Spain and Italy are most often mentioned as the future economic hot spots . Favored ventures include media , telecommunications and retailing .
area.n | 1 | The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush . San Francisco Bay %% area %% officials said nine people remain missing in the aftermath of last week 's earthquake . The death toll rose to 63 . The House , meanwhile , approved $ 2.85 billion to aid in the recovery from the temblor and from Hurricane Hugo as state legislators moved toward a temporary sales-tax increase .

area.n | 1 | But yesterday , the company said this year 's profit will be lower . It did n't say by how much . Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines , Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria %% area %% and temporarily shut its plant in York , Pa. , for two weeks in both November and December . For the first nine months of the year , Caterpillar said earnings fell 14 % to $ 390 million , or $ 3.85 a share , from $ 453 million , or $ 4.46 a share , a year earlier . Sales rose to $ 8.19 billion from $ 7.65 billion .
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .

I think that I 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here . And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our %% area %% . And if we 're not ombudsman for our area , we ought to be thrown out of office .

The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain %% areas %% of wholesale banking . Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said .
ask.v | 1 | `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really %% asking %% is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says . Then , he answers his own question . `` Yes , they are .
ask.v | 2 | Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . Washington rejected the bid , saying the hostages were n't linked to other issues . PLO leader Arafat %% asked %% Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said .

The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
ask.v | 1 | I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . And why not ? ? How , I %% asked %% , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ? If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .

ask.v | 1 | The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall . Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub . Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and %% asked %% if there was anything he could do for them . Harold shook his head . `` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .

The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America . `` Join me in another '' ? ? He had %% asked %% . `` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously . `` I do not drink so much '' .
ask.v | 1 | His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She %% asked %% him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
ask.v | 1 | A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass . It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla . `` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll %% ask %% the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .

My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ?
attempt.v | 1 | The President 's personality would have opened that office to him . And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had %% attempted %% to make it a successorship by inheritance . It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President 's condition for the nation .
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .

For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it . Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois ( the first time that a state has used its educational facilities %% authority %% to support construction of a theater ) , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets . The rest , he is confident , can be raised . His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
avoid.v | 1 | The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants . The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors %% avoid %% disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said . Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said . The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said .
avoid.v | 1 | She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . When there was bridge at Edythe 's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who 'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to %% avoid %% a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
base.n | 3 | It has more drug users than Boston has people . Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all . Its tax %% base %% is shrinking , a $ 1 billion budget deficit looms , and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year . This is New York City . When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins .
base.n | 1 | Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day . `` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president . The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a %% base %% cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .

begin.v | 2 | He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring . Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student , Eric Fearon , %% began %% months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage . They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells . Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .

The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson . But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll %% began %% focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
begin.v | 1 | When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would %% begin %% producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
believe.v | 1 | The workers can be motivated , and the company reach its full potential , only when management embraces the employees ' perspective . A. Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee , Fla . I %% believe %% Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece : the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others . A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management . Instead , he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates .
believe.v | 1 | He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image . He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . Some auto executives %% believe %% the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels .
believe.v | 1 | Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . For instance , some analysts %% believe %% bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past . Portfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio .
believe.v | 1 | The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They %% believe %% that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .

And if he surrendered after raving at her .
bill.n | 3 | DRUG WARS : A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers ' licenses of some drug offenders . The %% bill %% would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation . State Senator J.E. `` Buster '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use .
bill.n | 3 | The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion . A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits . And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the %% bill %% would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe . Separately , the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .
bill.n | 5 | And because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity . Because of the early settlement , the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account . However , analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury %% bills %% that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market . The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $ 2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday . Here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction :

The %% bills %% will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 , No non-competitive tenders will be accepted . Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
bill.n | 3 | This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers . A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the %% bill %% , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
bill.n | 4 | At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due . The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed . Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the %% bill %% . In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . Daniel Brigham
bill.n | 3 | In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . ) Also last spring , Rep. Ron Dellums ( D. , Calif. ) , introduced a %% bill %% requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement . In addition , products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping . The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain , especially remembering the 1987 defeat .
bill.n | 3 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying %% bill %% approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
bill.n | 5 | TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month %% bills %% at the regular weekly auction . Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
bill.n | 3 | But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the %% bill %% makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency . Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger . Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C. ) , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
bill.n | 3 | The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt . Supporters of the %% bill %% are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt . The panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market . `` It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort , '' Rep. James Oberstar ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee , said during the panel 's deliberations .
bill.n | 3 | That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations %% bills %% . ( Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . ) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
bill.n | 3 | But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . It was the first time in 20 years that such government %% bills %% were defeated . In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power .
build.v | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will %% build %% a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
build.v | 3 | With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it . But with every step I take , I 'm %% building %% wealth . You can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the bullet . So go out there and eat that debt .
build.v | 1 | It was a fortunate time in which to %% build %% , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
build.v | 1 | Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . `` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . He oughta be able to %% build %% a new house with all them contraptions '' . Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . `` I was just sayin ' to him that I 'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .
buy.v | 1 | At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help %% buy %% a 45-acre horse farm . `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your horse , '' he says . But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
buy.v | 1 | `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . `` The affluent people and the corporations can %% buy %% it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .
buy.v | 6 | Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to %% buy %% out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
buy.v | 1 | The air force is to take at least 250 more . Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack . Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to %% buy %% used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale . Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .
buy.v | 3 | A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . The theory relies on three assumptions : 1 ) Voters can `` %% buy %% '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) . 3 ) Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . NRM suspended its common distribution in June 1988 and the distribution on its $ 2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units in September . However , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting NRM 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise %% capital %% , NRM said . In following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last year , NRM also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ 2 million a year in administrative costs from the change . Under the plan , NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
capital.n | 1 | Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it . But , says Mr. Bock , `` It was a close call . '' The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce %% capital %% , entrepreneurs say . If start-ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions , `` we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , '' says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern . Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .
capital.n | 1 | The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. %% capital %% markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : Imo Industries Inc. -- $ 150 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2001 , priced at par to yield 12 % . The issue will be sold through Morgan Stanley & Co .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
capital.n | 2 | Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's %% capital %% of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . When the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .

Anatol Pawlowski 's leg begins jiggling beneath his desk . `` Solidarity does n't %% care %% for the good of this region , '' he says after a few pleasantries . `` They want to turn everything upside down in a week . Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used at the moment by a state farm .

And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch %% cared %% . Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .

carrier.n | 6 | `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % . Delta has benefited more than other %% carriers %% from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub . Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter . Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
carrier.n | 6 | Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . The %% carrier %% has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
carrier.n | 6 | StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas . StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada . The %% carrier %% has n't yet turned a profit .
cause.v | 1 | In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices . The case strikes at the corporate image of GE , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could %% cause %% a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance . The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices . But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of `` widespread '' fraudulent billing practices .
cause.v | 1 | He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what %% causes %% sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said .
chance.n | 1 | Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training , there is one more . And not just for the players . It 's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $ 1 million each for the %% chance %% to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers . `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don Sider , owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics . Early in the morning Mr. Sider , an estate lawyer , pores over last wills and testaments .
chance.n | 1 | Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . Mr. Breeden , not missing a %% chance %% to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange .
chance.n | 1 | When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp.

Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
claim.v | 2 | Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value %% claimed %% by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid . Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge . A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .

Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken . Grain , milk and meat %% come %% next . A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast . Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .

Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers %% came %% out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''

Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to %% come %% in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . `` We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .

Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .

But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost %% came %% to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .

Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he %% complained %% , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean .

GE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . The second portion will be %% completed %% the following year . GE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion .

NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto . The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other %% conditions %% . NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .

condition.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary %% conditions %% . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .

Valhi said the articles did n't accurately reflect Valhi and its affiliates ' intentions toward Lockheed . Instead , Valhi said , they may increase , decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings , depending on a number of %% conditions %% .
contribute.v | 2 | Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have %% contributed %% to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .
defense.n | 1 | In that decision , the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment . But last February , a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense . The appeals court said the %% defense %% is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision . General Dynamics appealed to the high court , backed by numerous business trade groups , arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely . General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber .
defense.n | 1 | `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week 's interview . He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position . But there is no %% defense %% at all for the ethos of the 1980s . We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989 : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .

The Iran-Contra judge agreed to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan , ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the %% defense %% . But the judge denied a request by the former national security adviser , who faces five criminal charges , to seek documents from Bush .

'' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to %% describe %% how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .
development.n | 1 | And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will , sooner or later , lead to its demise ? An alternative and more convincing explanation , confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program , is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market . For example , while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the %% development %% of a free market . Before becoming self-employed , or setting up a cooperative , workers must seek permission from the local soviet ( council ) . Permission is far from automatic : The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions , and they appear to be exercising these powers .
development.n | 1 | On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them . `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems %% development %% . Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year . `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
development.n | 1 | Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations . Some plan to pursue foreign development ventures , mostly in Europe . And other developers may shift from commercial to residential %% development %% in the U.S. . `` There are n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago , '' says Charles Shaw , a Chicago-based real estate developer . `` So developers are saying they will look into distressed properties .
development.n | 1 | New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond . Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage %% development %% in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves . The answer will be obvious . Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department 's National Institute of Justice .
development.n | 1 | It earned $ 76.4 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 quarter . General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments , an earnings recovery in submarine operations , and higher military aircraft sales . Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 %% development %% dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Northrop shares closed at $ 21.125 , off 25 cents . General Dynamics closed at $ 54.875 , up 50 cents .
disclose.v | 1 | Some become pseudo-lobbyists . John Mack promptly quit his job last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over Mr. Mack 's violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old . After a few weeks in seclusion , Mr. Mack opened a consulting firm , but not to enable him to directly lobby ; that would require him to %% disclose %% his clients by registering as a lobbyist . Still , Mr. Mack says he talks to `` 30 members of Congress a week . '' Misery Loves Company
disclose.v | 1 | Sale of Saatchi Unit Close Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi Computer Sciences would n't %% disclose %% the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply . But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue . Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale .
do.v | 1 | Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment . Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed . The producers , he says , did a good job of depicting someone `` who had %% done %% so much , but who was also a manic-depressive .
do.v | 1 | But it 's in very early stages still . '' Bloomingdale 's is a 17-store chain acquired last year by Campeau in its $ 6.6 billion acquisition of Federated . Bloomingdale 's %% does %% an estimated $ 1.2 billion in annual sales . The sale of Bloomingdale 's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $ 800 million in bridge financing for Campeau , which disclosed last month that its retailing units , Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. , were strapped for cash . O&Y , owned by Toronto 's Reichmann family , is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau , a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company .
do.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has %% done %% a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
do.v | 1 | Like which are droppable and which are not . With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers . But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who %% did %% the Katzenjammer Kids . ( In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . ) `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
do.v | 1 | Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get %% done %% . `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . `` If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest .

Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to %% do %% it out of current income , '' he says . `` That 's crazy . '' His advice : Do n't panic .
do.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you %% doing %% planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
drug.n | 1 | Rather ominously , rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects , Lancet , the British medical journal , reported in 1987 . However , Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the French physician who invented RU-486 , wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys . The %% drug %% has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES , the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it . All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion . A risk of birth defects , a sure source of lawsuits , is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486 .
drug.n | 2 | Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid . Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter . In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to %% drug %% cases . '' Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . '' Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
drug.n | 1 | The drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the %% drug %% 's usage for adults in March 1987 . But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . As a result , many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
drug.n | 1 | In addition , Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores . Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients . `` We believe that every %% drug %% that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a Ralph Nader affiliate . Dr. Teich said Searle is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available . According to federal officials and drug-industry studies , nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly , meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication .
drug.n | 2 | `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' Even at this early stage , %% drugs %% caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .
effect.n | 1 | Sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners . Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact on Boeing 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined . The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting %% effect %% on either Boeing or its work force . The company 's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared with $ 53.6 billion at the end of Although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ 5 billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 .
effect.n | 3 | Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take %% effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

effect.n | 1 | So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd. , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant . The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo . But whatever its %% effects %% on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand . Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s . Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
effect.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any %% effect %% on us . We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . '' The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
effect.n | 1 | William E. Downing , Pacific Bell 's vice president of customer services for the Bay area , says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50 % of all calls . Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50 % of its calls locally . Ironically , the long-term %% effect %% of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation 's gross national product . It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways . `` It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help , '' says Beth Burnham Mace , a regional economist at DRI\/McGraw Hill , a Lexington , Mass. , forecasting firm .
effect.n | 3 | An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35 % , Mr. Gurria said . The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans . The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of Mexico 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into %% effect %% in early China 's top film actress , Liu Xiaoqing , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in Shandong province , the People 's Daily reported . The amount is equal to about 30 years earnings for the average peasant , who makes $ 145 a year ... .

The Delicious hegemony wo n't %% end %% anytime soon . New apple trees grow slowly , and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom . Its roots are patriotic -- with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact .

The benchmark 30-year bond %% ended %% at a price of 102 3\/32 , compared with 101 17\/32 Friday . The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % .
end.v | 1 | Although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change . Clearly , the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz . Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland , he was eight years old when World War II %% ended %% . Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany 's division . Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member , Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker .
end.v | 1 | Out and out and never to return again . Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped . That was the day it %% ended %% . The freight car was cold , early in the morning . He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .

Winston %% enjoyed %% seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style . When he was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace . At home , he would n't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .
estimate.v | 1 | The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published . The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed . The institute did n't %% estimate %% annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 . The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
estimate.v | 1 | Amtech Systems Inc. , Tempe , Ariz. , said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate `` substantial improvement '' over the previous fiscal year . Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . Per-share earnings are %% estimated %% at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million . Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November .
estimate.v | 1 | Californians , meanwhile , tried to cope with still-limited services , blocked roadways and water shortages in the aftermath of the tremor that left scores dead and injured . Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington %% estimated %% that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag .
examine.v | 2 | Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news . No sooner did they hear of Dan 's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action . The wound in his scalp was %% examined %% , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals . From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food . Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag '' .
exchange.n | 5 | These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions . In an interest-rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period . In a forward-rate agreement , a client agrees to an %% exchange %% rate on a future currency transaction . Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem . Started three years ago , Chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field .
exchange.n | 5 | As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . With inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . To keep the %% exchange %% rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York %% exchanges %% have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . So far there is little to show for such efforts .
exchange.n | 3 | Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis . In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee , Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , who told a House panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets . Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the %% exchanges %% might be closed . He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency . But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .
exchange.n | 5 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed %% exchange %% rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .
exchange.n | 3 | The new stock baskets `` are going to make it easier for program trading to be done . And it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' Both the Big Board 's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago %% exchange %% 's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors . The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans , mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . In index arbitrage , program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets .

At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
exchange.n | 1 | It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents . Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from %% exchange %% agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .
exchange.n | 3 | Shares closed lower in other major Asian and Pacific markets , including Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Wellington , Seoul and Manila . Most of those markets had rebounded the day before from Monday 's slide . But unlike the Tokyo %% exchange %% , they failed to extend the rise to a second session . Elsewhere , prices surged for a second day in Frankfurt , closed higher in Zurich , Stockholm and Amsterdam and were broadly lower in Milan , Paris and Brussels . South African gold stocks ended marginally firmer .
exchange.n | 3 | Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco , while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out . But Dale Irvine , director of the emergency center , said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas . In Chicago yesterday , Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific %% exchange %% options . The firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange '' even if the exchange is closed , said Wayne Luthringshausen , chairman of Options Clearing . ( Put options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to sell a financial instrument at a specified price , while call options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy a financial instrument at a specified price ) .
exchange.n | 3 | A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies . `` It was their business decision , '' the official said . Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. %% exchanges %% , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .
exist.v | 1 | One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . He said , while dialogue is important , enough forums already %% exist %% `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party . According to West German government sources , Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change .
exist.v | 1 | Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to %% exist %% at all . And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .
explain.v | 1 | While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe . Second , it %% explains %% why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office . For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .
explain.v | 1 | `` Whatever you say '' . Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered . `` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to %% explain %% that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . `` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly . `` He 'll know when you tell him .

The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . But in general , all foreign-trading companies are %% feeling %% the pinch . `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . `` On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
feel.v | 1 | 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were %% felt %% with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it . `` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not %% feel %% entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' . With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He %% felt %% a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
feel.v | 1 | We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it . I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant . Whatever we %% felt %% about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun . I wanted to wipe my flint , but I did n't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming . The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .
feel.v | 1 | This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh -- a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . Mercer got the blissful needle . When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he %% felt %% the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body . He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
feel.v | 1 | He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg %% felt %% himself developing a case of claustrophobia . The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in . If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
feel.v | 1 | On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age . %% Feeling %% suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human . Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
feel.v | 1 | I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night 's melancholy . My head was clear . I was hungry as a wolf , and my body %% felt %% lean and vital . `` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .
feel.v | 1 | If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . I love you , I hate you , I %% feel %% like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you 're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . So I went about my business . I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .

Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration %% finds %% itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
find.v | 3 | It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more . It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes . It is also the kind of libel politicians %% find %% useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency . But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
find.v | 5 | The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
find.v | 1 | It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do . Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives . Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora %% finds %% an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold . While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom . In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
find.v | 1 | The rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . As rescuers pressed their efforts after %% finding %% a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . In Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . Estimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion .

future.n | 3 | Separately , Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security . Current rules permit investors to put up less cash for %% futures %% than for stocks . Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility . These rules , they say , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line .
future.n | 3 | The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. %% futures %% exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision . Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are . The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
future.n | 3 | It 's too disruptive , '' he says . `` It is n't investing . '' But stock-index %% futures %% have plenty of support . Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks . They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures .
future.n | 3 | The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . But owning index %% futures %% is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
future.n | 3 | Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends , as well as continued export strength . A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices . Wheat %% futures %% prices fell , however , at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis . Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company , C&D Commodities , could be reached for comment . As for corn and soybean futures , `` a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early trading , said Steven Freed , a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago .
future.n | 3 | `` There was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P %% futures %% in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath . Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index . The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 3 | Friday 's Market Activity Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading . Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index %% futures %% and options , and options on individual stocks . But there were fewer price swings than expected . Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange .

But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the %% future %% , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history . The broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .

As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index %% futures %% pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .

go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .

go.v | 7 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're %% going %% to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .

The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .

Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? `` You 're not %% going %% to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
go.v | 1 | Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . Smith-Kline Beecham %% goes %% further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .

So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
hold.v | 5 | Under the direction of its new chairman , Francisco Luzon , Spain 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization . The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in Banco Exterior . The government directly owns 51.4 % and Factorex , a financial services company , %% holds %% 8.42 % . The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges . Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .
hold.v | 4 | Medieval philosophers used to %% hold %% the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .

Hungary declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the Soviet Union . A crowd estimated at 100,000 %% held %% a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman said .
hold.v | 5 | Lep Group PLC of Britain , which %% holds %% a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . It noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .
hope.v | 1 | Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring . And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded . Two bills in Congress %% hope %% to make such restrictions national . In May , Rep. Don Edwards ( D. Calif . ) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . ( The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . )
hope.v | 1 | Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel %% hope %% to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .

She had spent too many hours looking ahead , %% hoping %% and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness . And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all .
hour.n | 4 | Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants . Meanwhile , at home , Mitsubishi has control of some major projects . It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama , about an %% hour %% outside Tokyo . The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year . The centerpiece of that complex , the Landmark Tower , will be Japan 's tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .

The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market . West Germany 's biggest union , IG Metall , said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter %% hours %% with strikes against the nation 's automotive , steel and engineering industries . Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in next year 's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal . A major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37 .

Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this .
hour.n | 1 | The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . The shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several %% hours %% earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif . The five astronauts , who stowed gear and tested the spacecraft 's steering , said they were unconcerned about the touchy weather expected in the Mojave Desert . Commonwealth leaders issued a declaration giving South Africa six months to deliver on pledges to ease apartheid or face new reprisals .
hour.n | 1 | Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact . Tuesday night , thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel . Runways at San Francisco were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an %% hour %% normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows , an FAA spokeswoman said . While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in Sacramento and Stockton , Calif. ; Reno and Las Vegas , Nev. ; and Los Angeles . United Airlines , the largest carrier at San Francisco , was operating only 50 % of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area .
improve.v | 1 | Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to %% improve %% the operation of capital markets . For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .
job.n | 2 | Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ 4.25 an hour by the end of 1991 , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . Under the compromise , the $ 4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training subminimum would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their %% jobs %% . Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers .
job.n | 1 | The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60 % or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain . Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130 % in less than two years , the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk . `` There 's a distinct possibility that I may lose my %% job %% over this , '' the employee , Karen Allen , of Floor Covering Resources , Kensington , Md. , recently told a congressional hearing . She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment . For employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .

By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room , Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs . The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 %% jobs %% , 95,400 of them in the tourist industry . Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms . Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage .
job.n | 1 | `` In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . '' What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots . Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's %% job %% classifications into Federal 's . Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers . These groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force .
job.n | 3 | If you think you have stress-related problems on the %% job %% , there 's good news and bad news . You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
job.n | 1 | They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork , and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar . Rep. Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . She says it 'd create 600 %% jobs %% and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''

That was when the tame old Peasants ' Party , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the Communists and %% joined %% with Solidarity in the East Bloc 's first liberated government . But by the time Solidarity took office in September , the damage was done . `` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
join.v | 1 | As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities . In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras %% joined %% under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor . In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini 's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .
keep.v | 1 | Still , some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones . `` We just took another floor for our London offices , '' said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are %% keeping %% mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` European companies are looking to buy American ones , '' said Henry King , the managing partner at that firm . `` But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions . ''
keep.v | 8 | If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . Then , in 1988 , a proposal to %% keep %% better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members .
keep.v | 1 | Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already ! We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we %% keep %% disposing of it . Bank it ? Not really !
keep.v | 1 | He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
keep.v | 4 | Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade . He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor 's cap to %% keep %% it from blowing in his eyes . Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars . He stood very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below .
keep.v | 5 | If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he %% keep %% the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
keep.v | 8 | `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to %% keep %% up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
keep.v | 1 | Then they took a taxi to Trastevere . `` There 's a church you should see '' , she said . And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to %% keep %% a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto . He let her tell him all about the church . Then they had dinner .

kill.v | 1 | Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . `` When elephants start fighting , ants get %% killed %% , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
kill.v | 1 | `` Anyway '' , Waddell went on . `` It 's nothing to fool with . It can %% kill %% you . Personally , I do n't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' . `` Nobody 's giving anything up '' , Robinson said .
kill.v | 1 | The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . I 'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to %% kill %% it at last , for it could never live . The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . `` It 's a big snake , is n't it '' ? ? He said .
lead.v | 1 | Big Board officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product . Already , many of the Big Board 's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product , with the $ 5 million minimum , will benefit only big institutional investors and could %% lead %% to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading , which last month accounted for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average daily volume . `` The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here , '' said James Andrews , head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia .
lead.v | 4 | It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would %% lead %% a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
lead.v | 4 | Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . `` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has %% led %% Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . `` The Americans have left him without a way out . It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . ''
lead.v | 4 | Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat . Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney . Mrs. Hewlitt %% led %% the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton 's house , a roof that signified gout . Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life .
lead.v | 5 | Move over , General Motors '' . `` It 's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face . `` You 're %% leading %% Dad down the garden path '' . `` Your garden , God damn it '' ! ! William said . `` I do n't enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said .
maintain.v | 1 | Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom %% maintain %% close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
maintain.v | 2 | Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never %% maintained %% that sex was all . Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . And D.H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
management.n | 2 | Three years later , machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire . Once again the company 's future looked less than rosy . But after restructuring under new %% management %% , the profits began rolling in . A major boost to Mr. Rey 's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 % of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks . They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad .
management.n | 2 | CMS ENERGY Corp. said %% management %% would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year . The Dearborn , Mich. , energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant . In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .
management.n | 1 | Boston Co. , the upper-crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year , has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates backfired . Boston Co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent , Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , which has relied heavily on the banking and money %% management %% unit 's contributions in recent years . In 1988 , for example , Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million , while Shearson managed net income of just $ 96 million . Shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries .
management.n | 1 | Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the %% management %% contract . Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr .
management.n | 2 | When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy %% management %% consultants . `` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
management.n | 2 | UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase . Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake . UAL %% management %% was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake . The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing . Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
management.n | 2 | Prospect Group Inc. , whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. failed for lack of financing , apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway . As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an `` amiable agreement , '' Prospect Group will wind up with control of top %% management %% posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment . In a management restructuring , Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman , chief executive and a director , while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director . Mr. Sheinberg remains as executive vice president .
management.n | 2 | To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . '' None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater %% management %% equity participation . Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer .
move.n | 2 | It includes removing $ 242 million in good will from the books , issuing $ 150 million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for $ 52 million in convertible bonds . During the third quarter , the company charged about $ 46 million against earnings in reducing goodwill , added $ 20 million to its general loan loss reserves and established a $ 30 million reserve for its high-yield bond portfolio . The company said its junk-bond portfolio after these %% moves %% had been reduced to less than 1 % of assets .
move.n | 2 | Better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience . So Mr. Lawson had to resign . In the end his %% move %% was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan 's autobiography in The American Economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal . But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable . What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen .
move.n | 1 | Unless , of course , it happens to be run by the Rothschilds . After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall . Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its %% move %% as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992 . Yet the Rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision . In 1796 , Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London , Paris , Vienna and Naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century .
move.n | 2 | The Communist Party chief , facing what is viewed as the nation 's worst unrest in nearly 40 years , also said he would allow East Germans to travel abroad more freely , but made clear that the Berlin Wall would remain . A Lebanese Christian alliance accepted an Arab-sponsored proposal aimed at ending Lebanon 's 14-year-old civil war . The %% move %% by the coalition of political parties and Lebanon 's largest Christian militia isolated military chief Aoun , who has rejected the plan , which includes political changes and a Syrian troop withdrawal from Beirut . Baker offered to review Israel 's `` suggested changes '' to his proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks . But the secretary of state advised Israel that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at Mideast peace .
move.n | 3 | And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move . Now , after only a dozen %% moves %% , spectators were looking for a mating combination . On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
move.n | 2 | Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the %% move %% is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover . Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
move.n | 2 | Baxter International Inc. , citing cost-cutting %% moves %% and increased sales of its home-care products and dialysis treatments , posted a 20 % rise in third-quarter net income on a 5.9 % sales boost . The Deerfield , Ill. , medical products and services company posted net of $ 102 million , or 34 cents a share , compared with $ 85 million , or 28 cents a share , a year ago . Sales totaled $ 1.81 billion up from $ 1.71 billion the previous year .
move.n | 2 | Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL , parent of United Airlines , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit . Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . The lightning %% moves %% show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues . The industrial average closed down 18.65 , to 2638.73 .
need.v | 1 | Advertisers already are balking at higher prices . `` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam . `` If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs , they 're likely to lose all but a few who %% need %% sports , above all . '' Viewers may not be cheering , either . Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials .
need.v | 1 | Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' They %% needed %% new crises to generate new grants and contracts . In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
need.v | 2 | The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals . Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building . `` We %% need %% to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman . About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 .
need.v | 1 | Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea . The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country 's leader . A White House spokesman said that while Bush would n't alter a longstanding ban on such involvement , `` there 's a clarification %% needed %% '' on its interpretation . India 's Gandhi called for parliamentary elections next month . The balloting , considered a test for the prime minister and the ruling Congress ( I ) Party , comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption .

But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .
negotiate.v | 1 | Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel , the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50 % foreign ownership . U.S. companies account for less than 8 % of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987 . But some U.S. companies are %% negotiating %% projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched . Chevron Corp. , Amoco Corp. , Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures . Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture .
network.n | 3 | In Japan , those functions account for only about a third of the software market . Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the U.S. , are still more common in Japan than PCs . In the U.S. , one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of %% network %% . In Japan , about 1 % are linked . `` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says Roger J. Boisvert , who manages the integrated-technologies group in McKinsey & Co. 's Tokyo office .
network.n | 2 | The show also signals Mr. Vila 's return as a television celebrity . Earlier this year , public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements . With Mr. Vila as host , `` This Old House '' became one of the Public Broadcasting Service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the %% network %% 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers . But Home Depot Inc. , an Atlanta-based home center chain , objected when Mr. Vila started doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers , a New Jersey building supply company that competes with Home Depot in some markets . `` I 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said Mr. Vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` Home Again with Bob Vila .

Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically . So-called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos , gossip , technical data , schedules and directives distributed over local and national computer %% networks %% . `` All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , '' says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem . Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans to develop it for commercial use .
network.n | 2 | Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season . '' He declined to elaborate . NBC 's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows , although the %% network %% declined to comment . One major NBC affiliate , KCRA in Sacramento , plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast . The one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings .
occur.v | 1 | Further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change . With regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? ? A number of considerations suggest that this %% occurs %% early in the process . Change involves the displacement of form . This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .

order.n | 6 | Still , Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity . Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an %% order %% for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
order.n | 2 | Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the %% order %% of 1 % or 2 % a year . The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .

order.n | 6 | National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co. , Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost %% orders %% following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .
order.n | 6 | That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York . She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means . '' While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the %% orders %% total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
order.n | 6 | Betty Raptopoulos , senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . She said the market hit the $ 1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders . More stop-loss %% orders %% were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year . She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range .
order.n | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under %% orders %% to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .
order.n | 6 | The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit %% orders %% turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
order.n | 6 | For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . `` Day %% orders %% '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .

And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina , government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment . Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's new %% order %% has n't arrived without resistance . Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations . Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of Mexican nationalism , to foreigners .

Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year . The company attributed the decrease in %% part %% to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts . U.K. sales for last year 's quarter were about $ 3 million .

Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . Most of the land in that and other %% parts %% of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .

The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation , a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather than illuminate , each other . Ms. Bogart 's cast is %% part %% and parcel of the problem . Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna .

A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been %% part %% of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe . Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law .

First City 's portfolio includes approximately 640,000 accounts with about $ 550 million in loans outstanding .
part.n | 1 | A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland . Also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most %% parts %% of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . Of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation 's capital of high technology . Like other major American cities , the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors .

There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban %% people %% . Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .

More recently , Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security , and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo . Faced with another Mr. Honecker , so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German %% peoples %% will get their reunification , de facto , on West German ground . But if East Germany 's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental .

The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of %% people %% between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % .

plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .

GM said the assembly %% plant %% , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .

By yesterday morning , much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone . West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets .
plant.n | 1 | SsangYong , which has only about 3 % of the domestic market , will sell about 18,000 of its models this year , twice as many as last year . It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year . The company plans to expand %% plant %% capacity 50 % by 1991 . By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 . Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit .
point.n | 14 | Germany 's 7 % bond due October 1999 was unchanged at 99.35 to yield 7.09 % while the 6 3\/4 % notes due July 1994 rose 0.025 point to 97.275 to yield 7.445 % . Japanese government bonds showed little change . Japan 's benchmark No. 111 issue due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.90 , down 0.02 %% point %% , to yield 5.435 % . British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by John Major , the new Chancellor of the Exchequer . Britain 's benchmark 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 rose 2\/32 to 111 1\/2 to yield 10.14 % while the 11 3\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 21\/32 to yield 12.95 % .
point.n | 14 | The benchmark 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 rose 10\/32 to 111 14\/32 to yield 10.14 % , while the Treasury 's 12 % notes due 1995 rose 7\/32 to 103 5\/8 to yield 11.04 % . West German government bonds fell as much as 0.60 point in light , nervous trading . The 7 % Treasury bond due October 1999 ended off 0.60 point to 99.35 to yield 7.09 % , while the 6 3\/4 % notes due 1994 fell 0.35 %% point %% to 97.25 to yield 7.45 % . Japanese government bonds continued to erode as the dollar remained resilient against the yen . Japan 's No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended the day on brokers screens at 95.11 to yield 5.43 % .
point.n | 14 | In other markets : -- The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rallied Friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to Nestle Foods Corp. for $ 370 million . The sale price , which was above Wall Street expectations , sent many RJR securities up by one %% point %% . `` It shows that there are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today 's market , '' said Robert Long , managing director and head of the high-yield research department at First Boston Corp . Many of the RJR securities , which had been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session , bounced back after the company 's announcement that it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods , a unit of the Swiss-based food concern .
point.n | 14 | But Mr. Greenspan , who has repeatedly said the Fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . '' He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage %% point %% a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter . He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement . Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
point.n | 14 | Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months . Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year . The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage %% point %% in the latest week to 7.85 % . Long-term CDs declined just a fraction . The average yield on both two-year CDs and five-year CDs was 7.98 % .
point.n | 14 | Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage %% points %% statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
point.n | 14 | But then steady , concentrated buying by Bear , Stearns & Co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in UAL , which eventually buoyed the entire market . The industrial average closed down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 . Late in the afternoon , several big purchases by Bear , Stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $ 150 a share , triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 %% points %% in the final hour of trading . UAL stock closed at $ 170 a share , down $ 8.375 . Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares , or 22 % of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding .
point.n | 14 | `` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . '' He seems to be typical of many professional money managers . When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage %% point %% more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . On Friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
point.n | 14 | `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . The Tokyo Stock Price Index ( Topix ) of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 . The Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 %% points %% , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 . Volume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares , up from 28 million Thursday . In turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday .
point.n | 14 | Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities . Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 %% point %% with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains . Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week . Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
point.n | 14 | With stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said Brian J. Fabbri , chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc . `` If the stock market tremors are behind us , then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest rates are heading . The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 %% point %% , or about $ 3.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little changed . Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday 's levels . Most junk bonds , which have been battered in recent weeks , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
point.n | 14 | Like most analysts , Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month 's numbers ; but he said , `` It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe . '' The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide . The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 %% points %% lower at 2638.73 . `` This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist for Mellon Bank . `` It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them . ''
point.n | 14 | But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors . Some so-called high-quality junk issues , such as R.H. Macy & Co. 's 14 1\/2 % subordinated debentures , rose . The Macy 's issue closed up about one %% point %% at a bid price of 97 . The TVA 's public debt offering was its first in 15 years . Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion .
point.n | 14 | literally . Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 99 points in seconds . A minute later it soared 128 %% points %% , then zoomed back down 113 points , 69 below Friday 's close . `` It was crazy , '' said Neil Weisman , general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp . `` It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . ''
policy.n | 1 | It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world 's environmental problems ( `` Is Science , or Private Gain , Driving Ozone %% Policy %% ? '' by George Melloan , Business World , Oct. 24 ) . To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted . Consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure .
policy.n | 1 | To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary %% policy %% . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .
policy.n | 1 | Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn . Moreover , state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets , bankers say . The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government %% policy %% . In August , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard . At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation .
policy.n | 1 | But the guidelines could `` make it impossible to commercialize research , '' says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 . After that , it will make a final decision on the %% policy %% . The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start-up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture-capital firm . With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
policy.n | 1 | California 's insurance commissioner does n't hold hearings on acquisition applications . Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa . He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies , and would `` help define %% policies %% and strategies of the group . '' Farmers was quick yesterday to point out the many negative aspects it sees in having Axa as its parent . For one , Axa plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $ 600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses .
policy.n | 1 | What are the facts on this type of lending ? The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching %% policy %% reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's .
policy.n | 1 | He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of %% policies %% to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
policy.n | 1 | This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national %% policy %% making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff . An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder ) .
policy.n | 1 | But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . President Bush told reporters : `` Whether that { the leadership change } reflects a change in East-West relations , I do n't think so . Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the %% policies %% of Honecker . '' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
policy.n | 2 | Paramedics were called . A week later , the man told Mr. MacInnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . `` It was a powerful point in my career , '' says the 31-year-old Mr. MacInnis , who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability %% policy %% for his business . `` But he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there were still six people in line waiting for a massage . The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her .
position.n | 5 | Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional %% position %% . And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .
position.n | 4 | `` I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time , '' he said . But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session . That bill , proposed by the SEC last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial %% positions %% of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets . The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden does n't . Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .
position.n | 2 | `` In all honesty if you ask me , ` Is this man a true believer ? ' I do n't know , '' says John Fowler , head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc . Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's %% position %% on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention . He 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
position.n | 4 | The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared with 0.94 day a month ago . Among bigger OTC stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume , compared with 2.14 days in September . The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short %% position %% change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 ( see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25 , 1989 ) .
position.n | 3 | General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong %% positions %% in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
position.n | 3 | Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach , Calif. , thrift . Mercury , which has assets of more than $ 2 billion and 24 branches in California , said the action to improve its regulatory capital %% position %% is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation . Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco . Mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ 4.875 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
position.n | 6 | Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership %% position %% in the coffee business . But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers . `` Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .

In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management .
power.n | 1 | If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal %% power %% , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika . Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform . But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
power.n | 1 | `` It puts this president in the legislative business , '' he declares . `` That 's not what our fathers had in mind . '' In addition to giving a president %% powers %% to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress , Rep. Edwards argues , a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers . He notes that , as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area , he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system . If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative , Rep. Edwards says , the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman `` shapes up '' on the foreign-policy issue .
power.n | 3 | The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides %% power %% to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
power.n | 3 | Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January The biggest change in Northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously . Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear %% power %% plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds . Northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million . In addition , Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .
power.n | 3 | But Conner is n't standing still . Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can .

The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment , Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik , to the major shareholder in the companies , Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V . Combustion Engineering , which provides engineered products , systems and services for %% power %% generation , also sold Illinois Minerals Co. , based in Cairo , Ill . That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp . Assets of Construction Equipment International , Houston , were sold to Essex Crane Inc. , and the assets of Elgin Electronics , Erie , Pa. , were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc .
power.n | 1 | Leveraged buy-outs may be curbed by two rules in pending congressional legislation . The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the %% power %% to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low .
power.n | 1 | It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . `` He started building the files that helped him gain %% power %% . '' A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information .

QUOTABLE : In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .

A company spokesman did n't know Mr. Wakeman 's age . James R.

Arthur B. Crozier , 34 , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John Virtue , who was another of the ousted directors .
president.n | 1 | In response to the internationalization of the business , Mr. Sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries .

president.n | 1 | Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is . Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts . Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers . Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year . Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
president.n | 1 | `` There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . '' BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . William O. McCoy , %% president %% of the company 's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit , said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9 % in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter . Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable . For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .
president.n | 1 | Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , %% president %% of Bear Stearns Cos . Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility .

Elected as directors were Mr. Hollander , Frederick Ezekiel , Frederick Ross , Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier . Removed from office were George Pratt , Robert E. Davis , Norman Gray , John Virtue , corporate secretary , and Barrett B. Weekes , chairman , %% president %% and chief executive officer . Newport officials did n't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier , Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board .
president.n | 1 | But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice %% president %% of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco . `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive . Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .

president.n | 1 | One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's %% president %% . There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor ( and now the governor of Texas ! ) and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees . `` You stay out of it , '' author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying .
president.n | 3 | And the vacillation did n't end there . Just a month ago , Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life . Then , two weeks ago -- declaring that `` I 'm not looking for any conflict over this '' -- the %% president %% said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest . But only four days after that , Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat . `` I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend .
president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 1 | Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. , Grosse Pointe Shores , Mich. , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year . Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly . Erich Krampe , %% president %% of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes . Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to-$50,000 price range , where Mercedes has a 35 % U.S. market share . Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .
president.n | 1 | And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , %% president %% of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
president.n | 1 | In the director post , Mr. Brown , 38 years old , succeeds Joseph W. Hibben , who retired from the board in August . C. Barr Schuler , 49 , vice president and chief financial officer , was named senior vice president of corporate development and acquisitions , a new post . Phillip J.

president.n | 1 | If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice %% president %% - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios . And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
president.n | 1 | The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air . One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors . Glenn Cox , Phillips ' %% president %% and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 . The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
president.n | 1 | Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th . Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week . `` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice %% president %% at T. Rowe Price Associates . `` People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . '' Source : Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
president.n | 1 | Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . Alan D'Agosto , %% president %% of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
president.n | 3 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the %% president %% complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
president.n | 1 | That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice %% president %% of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
president.n | 1 | Robert A. Oswald , chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company , was elected to the additional position of executive vice %% president %% . In addition , Michael W. O'Donnell , executive vice president of a Columbia unit , was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company . The appointments take effect Nov. 1 .
president.n | 1 | `` Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . '' Campbell Soup Co. , for one , has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands . `` The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 , '' says Tony Adams , the company 's vice %% president %% for marketing research . `` The best odds are with your core franchise . Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we 'd like to increase that . ''
president.n | 1 | Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985 , and before that was president of Public Strategies , a Washington consulting firm . He is well-known in Democratic circles , having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale 's 1984 presidential campaign . At Fannie Mae , he will take responsibility for the corporation 's financial and legal areas and will work with David Maxwell , chairman and chief executive officer , and Roger Birk , %% president %% and chief operating officer , on strategic planning . Mr. Johnson , 45 years old , has been a consultant on strategy to Fannie Mae for the past 3 1\/2 years . In an interview , he said Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push to broaden its activities overseas .
president.n | 1 | Charles S. Mitchell , a vice %% president %% with Homart Development Co. , the real estate development subsidiary of Sears , Roebuck & Co. , was named president of Figgie Properties , a real estate development unit . He succeeds William Kohut , who resigned earlier this year . Also , Richard A. Barkley , a former marketing executive with FMC Corp. , was appointed president of Continental Container Systems , a producer of can closing machinery that Figgie acquired late last year .
president.n | 1 | But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning , dashed those expectations . Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt . `` Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said Roger Early , a vice %% president %% at Federated Investors Inc. , Pittsburgh . `` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . '' Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations .
president.n | 1 | Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice %% president %% of this graphics equipment company . He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco . And , according to one dealer , Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' Nicholas Hall , the %% president %% of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money . People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter . ''

'' These days , `` Batibot '' is %% produced %% in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment . It is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks . With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` Batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs .
produce.v | 2 | Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' %% produced %% by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
produce.v | 1 | In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can %% produce %% previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
promise.v | 1 | CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience %% promised %% to advertisers . CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .

Consumers Power and Bechtel Power Corp. last year announced a joint venture to buy the plant , currently owned completely by the utility .
prove.v | 2 | Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family %% proved %% profitable to the auction house . Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
prove.v | 2 | He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing %% proved %% to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men 's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
purchase.v | 1 | One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to %% purchase %% the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned .
raise.v | 1 | But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations . The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further %% raises %% the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months .
raise.v | 1 | The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` stop-motion '' movie of the blood-filled vessel , ( like the `` stop-motion '' seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing ) . The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats . They 've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart %% raises %% and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , they report in Nature , a scientific journal . They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow . The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels .
raise.v | 1 | `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by %% raising %% or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
raise.v | 2 | Acting soothed him . On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . As Sir Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he %% raised %% his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now '' ? ? That was one of the high spots of the play . The audience , as usual , loved it .

'' Ultimately , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest %% rates %% on mortgage securities . At the moment , Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments . But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the 59-dealer selling group .

Pinkerton 's world headquarters today is a nondescript , two-story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport . Next , Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton 's rates , which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than California Plant Protection 's average %% rate %% of around $ 8.63 . And he got rid of low-margin businesses that just were n't making money for the company . Mr. Wathen , who says Pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ 8 million in 1987 under American Brands , boasts that he 's made Pinkerton 's profitable again .
rate.n | 1 | At the same time , a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago . Comments by John Major , who has succeeded Mr. Lawson , also failed to damp market concern , despite his pledge to maintain relatively high British interest rates . According to one London-based analyst , even higher interest %% rates %% wo n't help the pound if Britain 's government continues to appear unstable . One U.S. trader , however , dismissed sterling doomsayers while acknowledging there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit . `` There is no question that the situation is bad , but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should , '' he said .
rate.n | 1 | `` And where we are is bad . '' Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year . That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the %% rate %% down sharply in August and September . Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .

rate.n | 1 | We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience . Nearby Paul Craig Roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir Alan . Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating %% rates %% , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .

In addition , local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their Hong Kong-dollar exposure . The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered %% rate %% , or Hibor . It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's Eurodollar contract , which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate , the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks . If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong .

rate.n | 2 | In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a %% rate %% , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake . Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk . Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic , the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.

rate.n | 1 | So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's . From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time . Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest %% rates %% , though up a bit recently , are still low . And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment . But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding .

Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . Belo said it increased its effective tax %% rate %% to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 . The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year .
rate.n | 1 | The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London . In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ( $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange %% rates %% ) , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
rate.n | 2 | The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . But the %% rate %% of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
rate.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest %% rates %% as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
rate.n | 1 | Information systems posted a loss of $ 8 million , compared with a loss of $ 9 million a year earlier . Customer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % . A 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest %% rates %% . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Contel closed at $ 33.75 a share , down .50 cents .
rate.n | 1 | And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise %% rates %% on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April .
rate.n | 1 | As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . That %% rate %% would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
rate.n | 1 | Even so , `` We 're looking for chaos , '' said George Gray , a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation . `` If there 's any way you can do it , you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while . '' Most of San Francisco 's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel 's offers of %% rate %% cuts . `` Everyone left , '' said Peter Lang , reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel . The Westin St. Francis hotel , which survived the 1906 earthquake and fire , currently is less than 50 % occupied .

BANKERS ACCEPTANCES : 8.42 % 30 days ; 8.30 % 60 days ; 8.28 % 90 days ; 8.15 % 120 days ; 8.05 % 150 days ; 7.95 % 180 days . Negotiable , bank-backed business credit instruments typically financing an import order .
rate.n | 2 | Hence the LBO craze . But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet , and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way . The profit %% rate %% is still low and the Q ratio was only 65 % in 1987 and 68.9 % in 1988 . Result : a landscape littered with lemons , huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America . The mounting risks did not go unobserved , even in the mid-1980s .

Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7 % , mainly the result of four extraordinary items : a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year ; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third ; a %% rate %% refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues . Revenue slipped 1.2 % to $ 2.21 billion from $ 2.23 billion . The earnings drop had been expected .
rate.n | 1 | But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest %% rate %% to decline about one-quarter percentage point . The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks .
rate.n | 1 | James G. Zafris , president of Danvers Savings Bank , Danvers , Mass. , says the market turmoil `` is an absolute non-event for small business . '' For small companies , he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges . Mr. Zafris thinks %% rates %% are heading down , helping small companies . Peter Drake , biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently .
recall.v | 1 | Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . '' During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious . Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , %% recalls %% an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices . Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . `` People started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. Miranda recalls .

Says Mr. Bauman : `` If things get really tough , I can always auction it off at Sotheby 's .
receive.v | 1 | But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members %% received %% amounted to bribes . Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ( $ 880,000 ) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
receive.v | 1 | Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced . The higher payments will start with Social Security checks %% received %% on Jan. 3 , 1990 . Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month . The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year .
receive.v | 1 | Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who %% received %% the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
receive.v | 2 | I could n't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . There , Mother was %% received %% by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats . But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .
regard.v | 2 | Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and %% regarded %% us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .
remember.v | 1 | At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not %% remember %% , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now . We had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .

Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards . She closed her eyes , %% remembering %% the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
remember.v | 1 | But he was always persuaded out . He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never %% remember %% whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .
remove.v | 1 | Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , %% remove %% the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ? That is questionable , to say the least . Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .

replace.v | 1 | It was so dark that he did n't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had %% replaced %% his biwa with a friend . An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
report.v | 1 | Since then , deliveries have slumped . GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid-October to 69,980 , while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 . GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month , while other auto makers %% reported %% mixed results . All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period , however , with sales of all domestically made cars , including those built at Japanese-managed plants , falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier . The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
report.v | 1 | Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates . Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was %% reported %% earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say . `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer .
report.v | 1 | The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it %% reports %% operating results this week . Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 .

say.v | 1 | `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen . These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers %% said %% , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change . Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said . Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
say.v | 1 | As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas . The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs . The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts %% say %% . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .

Mr. Laff 's attorney , John Lang , filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness , Henry Lorin , told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed . The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang %% said %% was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff . In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York , Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the `` real master criminal '' behind the stock manipulation , and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it .

'' Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC %% said %% it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .

Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15 , satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the PLO . A U.S. counterterrorism official %% said %% experts are studying the Israeli list . `` We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15 , 1988 , '' he said , referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads . `` So far , this list does n't change our view .
say.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , %% said %% Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .

The report to Congress %% said %% that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people .

say.v | 1 | Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating . `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' %% says %% Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company . In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so .

say.v | 1 | And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen %% says %% he spends a lot of time lobbying . Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
say.v | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel %% said %% . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .

Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new .
say.v | 1 | Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .

Environmental lawyers %% say %% virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .
say.v | 1 | So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . While some %% say %% the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp .

All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . '' Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , %% says %% : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily .

say.v | 1 | The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters %% said %% their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . '' Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
say.v | 1 | The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said . Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible . An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee %% says %% some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill .

say.v | 1 | Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman %% said %% the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .

say.v | 1 | Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , %% says %% Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .

say.v | 1 | The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty %% says %% profits will be flat or lower . And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
say.v | 1 | Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he %% says %% . Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .

say.v | 1 | Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory %% said %% researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .

say.v | 1 | Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . They %% said %% the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .

Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he %% said %% .

see.v | 3 | Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , Hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important trait . Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one . Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be %% seen %% in two cities -- New York and Birmingham , Ala .

A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern %% set %% by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .

The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .

The %% state %% bar association 's policy making body , the House of Delegate , voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar 's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono . `` We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said Justin L.

state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .

Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the %% state %% over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .

New York City : Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970 , when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern %% states %% . In 1972 , the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts . This year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members .

Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .

'' The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens . As a result , GOP %% state %% Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes , to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v.

The Freind legislation -- the state 's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother . Mr. Freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the Supreme Court to review Roe and , perhaps , to overturn it .

The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .

And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it %% work %% , '' says Mr. Anderson . What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ?

The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some %% working %% for one 's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .

The grocery the youth %% worked %% for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off .
