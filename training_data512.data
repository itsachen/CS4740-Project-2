affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
believe.v | 1 | Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . As violently as possible . But he was so taken aback , he could not %% believe %% any rage of his would make her give in . On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . And if he surrendered after raving at her .
build.v | 1 | It was a fortunate time in which to %% build %% , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
care.v | 1 | Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch %% cared %% . Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .
come.v | 5 | Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
development.n | 1 | On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them . `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems %% development %% . Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year . `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
estimate.v | 1 | Californians , meanwhile , tried to cope with still-limited services , blocked roadways and water shortages in the aftermath of the tremor that left scores dead and injured . Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington %% estimated %% that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag .
explain.v | 1 | `` Whatever you say '' . Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered . `` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to %% explain %% that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . `` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly . `` He 'll know when you tell him .
find.v | 5 | The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
hour.n | 1 | Thieves stole a 12th century fresco from an abandoned church in Camerino , Italy , by removing the entire wall on which the work had been painted , police said ... . West Germany 's BMW commissioned the Nuremberg post office to test a prototype battery-powered car . The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an %% hour %% and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles .
keep.v | 1 | He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
move.n | 2 | Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL , parent of United Airlines , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit . Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . The lightning %% moves %% show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues . The industrial average closed down 18.65 , to 2638.73 .
order.n | 2 | Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest ? Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the %% order %% of 1 % or 2 % a year . The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs . J. Sigurd Nielsen Richmond , Va .
part.n | 1 | Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . `` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia . A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been %% part %% of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe . Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law . British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles .
people.n | 2 | `` The president does n't want to have legislative sanctions , '' says a U.S. official . `` But he may not have a choice . '' Given China 's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own %% people %% , Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions . Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations . Sentences have been stiff .
plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .
point.n | 14 | Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage %% points %% statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
power.n | 3 | But Conner is n't standing still . Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco . And , according to one dealer , Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' Nicholas Hall , the %% president %% of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money . People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George Wachter . ''
rate.n | 1 | He shut down the company 's tony New York headquarters . Pinkerton 's world headquarters today is a nondescript , two-story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport . Next , Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton 's rates , which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than California Plant Protection 's average %% rate %% of around $ 8.63 . And he got rid of low-margin businesses that just were n't making money for the company . Mr. Wathen , who says Pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ 8 million in 1987 under American Brands , boasts that he 's made Pinkerton 's profitable again .
rate.n | 1 | The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London . In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ( $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange %% rates %% ) , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
receive.v | 1 | But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members %% received %% amounted to bribes . Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ( $ 880,000 ) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
say.v | 1 | Banca Nazionale del Lavoro %% said %% its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ( $ 872 million ) , marking the bank 's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch . BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $ 3 billion without the Rome-based management 's approval . State-owned BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher Drogoul , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties .
say.v | 1 | `` If we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said Sen. Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . '' Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC %% said %% it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .
say.v | 1 | `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . '' She %% said %% copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday . However , David Threlkeld , president of Threlkeld & Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year . Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .
say.v | 1 | City building codes require construction that can resist temblors . In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster . `` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach %% said %% . On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts . California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans .
say.v | 1 | The North Texas Chevy Dealers recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite Easterners . And deposits at NCNB Texas National Bank , a unit of NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , have increased $ 2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to Texas . `` Obviously , pride sells in Texas , '' %% says %% a spokeswoman for Bozell Inc. , Omaha , Neb. , which represents The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` Texasness , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more Texan than Texans . Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like `` Connecticut and Long Island , '' sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet , a division of General Motors Corp .
share.n | 2 | Jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange . In late trading , the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ( $ 1.93 ) -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares . In the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar %% shares %% trading as American Depositary Receipts closed at $ 13.625 , up $ 1.75 . Analysts expect Ford will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about 900 pence ( $ 14.25 ) a share . Such a proposal values Jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion ( $ 2.53 billion ) .
share.n | 2 | Dime Savings Bank of New York was cleared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire Starpointe Savings Bank of Somerset , N.J. , the banks said . Starpointe holders , who approved the plan last April , will receive $ 21 in cash a %% share %% , or a total $ 63 million . The FDIC cleared the move yesterday , and the banks must wait at least 30 days before closing the purchase . A closing date has n't been set .
share.n | 2 | That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business . Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits . For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a %% share %% , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago . Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
share.n | 2 | `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI positions , Mr. Selkin said . Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . Philip Morris added 1 1\/8 to 44 1\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3\/8 to 70 3\/8 , Merck gained 1 3\/8 to 77 3\/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7\/8 to 43 3\/8 on 2.5 million %% shares %% . American Medical jumped 1 7\/8 to 23 5\/8 . IMA Acquisition , an investor group that includes First Boston and the Pritzker family of Chicago , said Chemical Bank had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $ 509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer .
share.n | 2 | '' Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said Stephen Reitman , European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew . Ford ca n't make a full-fledged bid for Jaguar until U.K. government restrictions expire . The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15 % of Jaguar %% shares %% without permission until Dec. 31 , 1990 . But with its 10.4 % stake , Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely . `` It 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar , observed Mr. Barber of James Capel .
source.n | 4 | `` They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a %% source %% of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
system.n | 4 | Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . '' The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets . A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking %% system %% . And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault .
turn.v | 1 | She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road . Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . She had begun to %% turn %% back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
value.n | 2 | Mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated -- but only temporarily . Their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors . The shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic %% value %% of a freezer full of meat . In Texas after Hurricane Alicia , major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to Houston , no gouging , just good will . Tom Mongan
