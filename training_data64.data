affect.v | 1 | The Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally %% affected %% them . It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it .
allow.v | 1 | The Bush administration said it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . But it would %% allow %% considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved . The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal , said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners .
allow.v | 1 | I recoil from the very thought . At the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ; ; if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ; ; and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite . Well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , %% allow %% psyches to have moral taste ? ? ) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion . You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm . I can see us now .
announce.v | 1 | Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . Goodson also %% announced %% that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
approve.v | 1 | The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six-month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday . The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , where the minimum will be $ 1.7 million . Also %% approved %% was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange . The basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash , said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest . New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said there have been concerns that the Big Board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility .
area.n | 2 | The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . ( net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad ) , some exports by professional firms ( a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine ) , and improved data from travel and tourism . In just these three areas , the Commerce Department found $ 23 billion more exports than previously reported and $ 11.6 billion more imports , with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $ 11.3 billion , to $ 19 billion . Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade %% areas %% , the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $ 20 billion a year . That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $ 75 billion than to $ 95 billion in 1988 , and $ 55 billion ( annualized ) rather than $ 80 billion in the first quarter of 1989 . These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar .
area.n | 1 | Other venture capitalists are already there : MMG Patricof Group and its Alan Patricof Associates , New York ; Burr , Egan , Deleage & Co. , Boston ; and San Francisco 's Hambrecht & Quist have about $ 800 million to invest in European companies . European venture capital funds total about $ 14 billion and are expected to continue growing 35 % annually . Continentals believe that the strongest growth %% area %% will be southern Europe . Spain and Italy are most often mentioned as the future economic hot spots . Favored ventures include media , telecommunications and retailing .
area.n | 1 | These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city %% areas %% may represent a major new untapped market for investment . New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
area.n | 1 | Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares , in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks , from 224.1 million Tuesday . Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September , due today , and tomorrow 's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown . In addition , activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake , which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay %% area %% . Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake , but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying . The early move essentially established the day 's trading range , and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently .
area.n | 1 | Intel also added 3\/8 to 33 7\/8 . But Sun Microsystems slipped 1\/4 to 17 1\/4 . Shares of biotechnology companies in the %% area %% were also higher . Chiron was up 1\/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1\/2 to 16 3\/8 . The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved , too .
ask.v | 1 | `` On a stand-alone basis , the network ought to make money , '' he says . When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does n't exactly say yes . `` What you 're really %% asking %% is , Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he says . Then , he answers his own question . `` Yes , they are .
ask.v | 1 | Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . He talked about 20 minutes . When he was through , the court members %% asked %% many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
ask.v | 1 | Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada . Finally she had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . `` How do you like it '' ? ? She had %% asked %% . Mr. Jack had said , `` You look about fifteen years old '' . `` Is that a compliment '' ? ?
ask.v | 1 | `` Hello , anyone at home '' ? ? Tanner wisecracked . `` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners . `` Are you my partner '' ? ? She %% asked %% hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform . `` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully . `` No one has come .
ask.v | 1 | His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . `` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She %% asked %% him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
ask.v | 1 | It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . `` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was %% asked %% whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me . `` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ?
authority.n | 3 | Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue . Sir Geoffrey Howe , deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS , has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership . Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt %% authorities %% move interest rates . Mrs. Thatcher `` does n't like taking orders from foreigners , '' says Tim Congdon , economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC . As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
authority.n | 1 | It 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs . For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade , not one new building has been devoted to it . Mr. Sagan , a former publisher and real estate developer , has put together an $ 8 million financial package that includes approximately $ 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois ( the first time that a state has used its educational facilities %% authority %% to support construction of a theater ) , and approximately $ 1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , the MacArthur Foundation , and a few other deep pockets . The rest , he is confident , can be raised . His board members alone have pledged $ 800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations .
avoid.v | 1 | She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . When there was bridge at Edythe 's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who 'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to %% avoid %% a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
base.n | 1 | Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day . `` We are operating an information refinery that takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge , '' says Yosi Amram , founder and president . The daily newsletter , which is n't widely available yet , will have a %% base %% cost of $ 2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service . One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm . `` They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , '' Mr. Amram says .
begin.v | 1 | A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper . Mr. Niciporuk sits . Anatol Pawlowski 's leg %% begins %% jiggling beneath his desk . `` Solidarity does n't care for the good of this region , '' he says after a few pleasantries . `` They want to turn everything upside down in a week .
begin.v | 1 | When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would %% begin %% producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
believe.v | 1 | He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image . He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . Some auto executives %% believe %% the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels .
believe.v | 1 | The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They %% believe %% that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South 's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
believe.v | 1 | Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . As violently as possible . But he was so taken aback , he could not %% believe %% any rage of his would make her give in . On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . And if he surrendered after raving at her .
bill.n | 3 | The estimated $ 1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year 's level , and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16 % to nearly $ 12.4 billion . A string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would continue to be developed within these limits . And while imposing a statutory cap of $ 1.6 billion on future spending , the %% bill %% would give NASA $ 30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission , a successor to the Voyager space probe . Separately , the National Science Foundation is promised a 7.7 % increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . And while pursuing these initiatives , Congress and the White House are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical care .
bill.n | 5 | The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today , raising all new cash . The %% bills %% will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21 , No non-competitive tenders will be accepted . Tenders , available in minimum denominations of $ 1 million , must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches .
bill.n | 4 | At the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due . The card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed . Typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the %% bill %% . In the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . Daniel Brigham
bill.n | 3 | But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . The underlying %% bill %% approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year .
bill.n | 3 | But yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants . Similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $ 1.6 million each in drug grants , or three times the current minimum . The odd mix of departments in the %% bill %% makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ 1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency . Lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville , Spain , but agreed elsewhere to $ 15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger . Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings ( D. , S.C. ) , who also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition television .
bill.n | 3 | That 's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get . If human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca n't -- let the computers do it . Congress , with a measure of White House complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations %% bills %% . ( Indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would have been even larger . ) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling .
build.v | 1 | Manville Corp. said it will %% build %% a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 .
build.v | 1 | It was a fortunate time in which to %% build %% , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
buy.v | 1 | At the Laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . Right now , Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for Karnak on the Nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help %% buy %% a 45-acre horse farm . `` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your horse , '' he says . But experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet .
buy.v | 6 | Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . Of course , one option would be for Manville to %% buy %% out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
buy.v | 3 | A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth . The theory relies on three assumptions : 1 ) Voters can `` %% buy %% '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 ) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues ( programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large ) and attending to local issues ( constituency service and pork barrel ) . 3 ) Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
capital.n | 1 | The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes . But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase %% capital %% and build up new areas of business . `` We 've got a lot to do , '' he acknowledged . `` We 've got to move quickly . ''
capital.n | 1 | HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market . Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts , particularly the less healthy ones , which have performed poorly even with a torrid market . But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new %% capital %% requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government 's massive thrift bailout bill . It said its real-estate operations earned a record $ 21.7 million , more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ 9 million . And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate , even with last week 's earthquake .
capital.n | 2 | But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state . Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city . In a letter to Mr. Bennett 's office , released yesterday , Washington 's city administrator , Carol Thompson , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the %% capital %% . Referring to Mr. Bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ 97 million in emergency federal support , Ms. Thompson wrote , `` Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure . '' Of his successes in Washington , Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .
capital.n | 1 | The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid . Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses , Hachette 's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs , practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs . Analysts said Hachette 's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a %% capital %% gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49 % owned by Hachette .
care.v | 1 | Somehow , all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die . And , therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony . No , the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch %% cared %% . Hal felt sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome . Yet , he told himself , this was the best way .
carrier.n | 6 | `` The key to Delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth , '' said Thomas Roeck , chief financial officer . Passenger traffic jumped 14 % in the quarter , while profit per passenger grew 2 % . Delta has benefited more than other %% carriers %% from the weakness of Eastern Airlines , which shares the Atlanta hub . Although Eastern is back to about 80 % of its pre-strike schedule now , the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter . Separately , America West Airlines , Phoenix , Ariz. , reported third-quarter profit jumped 45 % to $ 5.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 4 million , or 24 cents a share , a year earlier .
carrier.n | 6 | StatesWest has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas . StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada . The %% carrier %% has n't yet turned a profit .
cause.v | 1 | He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . Catherine Adams , the Beebes ' lawyer , said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . Scientists are only beginning to understand what %% causes %% sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case , she said . The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . But the Beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , Ms. Adams said .
chance.n | 1 | Though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress , mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them . Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . Mr. Breeden , not missing a %% chance %% to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . That event , he contended , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange .
claim.v | 2 | Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion . Northeast 's raised bid , which was supported by PS of New Hampshire 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in New Hampshire . The $ 2.25 billion value %% claimed %% by Northeast , based in Hartford , Conn. , is the highest yet given to a bid . Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow , a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge . A hearing is set for Nov. 15 , but participants do n't expect a resolution until July 1990 .
come.v | 1 | Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up . Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as Motor City executives , including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked to see the future . Even the Soviet Union %% came %% , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model . Here 's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported , and what the foreign visitors saw . New Technology
come.v | 4 | `` If the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . Ms. Raptopoulos noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky . Yesterday , for example , `` the durable goods numbers %% came %% out for September and the number was down only 0.1 % , '' she said . `` However , if you exclude defense-related orders then durable goods were down 3.9 % . I believe that number reflects a slowing economy . ''
come.v | 5 | Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . Pressure %% came %% from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
complain.v | 1 | The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice . Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal . `` Argiento , this is senseless '' , he %% complained %% , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather . `` You 're too clean . Scrub the studio once a week .
condition.n | 2 | As part of the transaction , Edisto agreed to give Mesa , an Amarillo , Texas , oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr. , a seat on its board . NRM said its $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto . The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23 , among other %% conditions %% . NRM said it expects unitholders to vote on the restructuring at a meeting Dec. 15 .
condition.n | 1 | Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary %% conditions %% . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
contribute.v | 2 | Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have %% contributed %% to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said .
defense.n | 1 | `` I 'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week 's interview . He was referring to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in Eastern Europe , and it is a defensible position . But there is no %% defense %% at all for the ethos of the 1980s . We did n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989 : Everything for sale ; nothing of real value .
defense.n | 7 | Nine-month net fell 9.5 % to $ 323.4 million , or $ 1.36 a share , from $ 357.2 million , or $ 1.32 a share , a year earlier . Revenue dropped 5.4 % to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.68 billion . This year 's nine-month results include gains of $ 13 million , or five cents a share , from the sale of Schlumberger 's %% defense %% systems business , and $ 22 million , or nine cents a share , from an award by the IranU.S . Claims Tribunal . The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $ 35 million , or 13 cents a share , from sale of the company 's Electricity Control & Transformers division .
describe.v | 1 | `` O ! ! Pioneers ! ! '' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $ 85,000 yearly ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to %% describe %% how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .
development.n | 1 | On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them . `` Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , '' said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems %% development %% . Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year . `` These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said .
development.n | 1 | New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond . Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage %% development %% in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves . The answer will be obvious . Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department 's National Institute of Justice .
disclose.v | 1 | Some become pseudo-lobbyists . John Mack promptly quit his job last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over Mr. Mack 's violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old . After a few weeks in seclusion , Mr. Mack opened a consulting firm , but not to enable him to directly lobby ; that would require him to %% disclose %% his clients by registering as a lobbyist . Still , Mr. Mack says he talks to `` 30 members of Congress a week . '' Misery Loves Company
do.v | 1 | Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment . Mr. Lieber , the actor who plays Mr. Hoffman , says he was concerned at first that the script would `` misrepresent an astute political mind , one that I admired , '' but that his concerns were allayed . The producers , he says , did a good job of depicting someone `` who had %% done %% so much , but who was also a manic-depressive .
do.v | 1 | Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has %% done %% a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
do.v | 1 | Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get %% done %% . `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . `` If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
do.v | 1 | They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers . But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap , so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges , ramps , etc. , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains . Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you %% doing %% planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon went away , while the shah -- he kept coming back .
drug.n | 2 | Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid . Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter . In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , `` I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to %% drug %% cases . '' Mr. Alito said his office `` just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . '' Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
drug.n | 1 | Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . Thrombinar , a %% drug %% used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
drug.n | 2 | `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . `` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' Even at this early stage , %% drugs %% caused additional concerns . During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination .
effect.n | 3 | Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person . Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now , he notes , may regret it later : `` Sometime , you 're going to have a Democratic president again '' who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives . `` Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take %% effect %% , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him , shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .

effect.n | 1 | Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any %% effect %% on us . We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . '' The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
effect.n | 3 | An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35 % , Mr. Gurria said . The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25 % interest rates , or providing fresh loans . The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of Mexico 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into %% effect %% in early China 's top film actress , Liu Xiaoqing , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in Shandong province , the People 's Daily reported . The amount is equal to about 30 years earnings for the average peasant , who makes $ 145 a year ... .

The benchmark 30-year bond %% ended %% at a price of 102 3\/32 , compared with 101 17\/32 Friday . The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % .

The freight car was cold , early in the morning . He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
estimate.v | 1 | The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate does n't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published . The agency noted , however , the estimate will likely be confirmed . The institute did n't %% estimate %% annual price growth in September , but a 0.2 % rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9 , up 3.3 % or 3.4 % from the year-earlier level of 173.1 . The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100 .
estimate.v | 1 | Californians , meanwhile , tried to cope with still-limited services , blocked roadways and water shortages in the aftermath of the tremor that left scores dead and injured . Thousands remained homeless . Bush is to visit the area today , and officials in Washington %% estimated %% that emergency assistance would total at least $ 2.5 billion . A series of earthquakes struck northern China , killing at least 29 people , injuring hundreds and razing about 8,000 homes , the Xinhua News Agency said . The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment sought by Bush to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag .
exchange.n | 5 | These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions . In an interest-rate options contract , a client pays a fee to a bank for custom-tailored protection against adverse interest-rate swings for a specified period . In a forward-rate agreement , a client agrees to an %% exchange %% rate on a future currency transaction . Some competitors maintain the interestrate option loss , in particular , may have resulted more from Chemical 's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem . Started three years ago , Chemical 's interest-rate options group was a leading force in the field .
exchange.n | 3 | `` We recognized the problem and took care of it . '' He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed . For years the five New York %% exchanges %% have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . Periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . So far there is little to show for such efforts .
exchange.n | 5 | `` If those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will be there , '' says Mr. Gilmore , the Securities and Futures Commission official . Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure . Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar , with a fixed %% exchange %% rate of HK$ 7.8 to the American currency , the U.S. and Hong Kong economies do n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go . In early 1988 , when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1 % . Just a few months ago , the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5 % , while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11 % .
exchange.n | 1 | At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in %% exchange %% for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal . At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
exchange.n | 3 | Shares closed lower in other major Asian and Pacific markets , including Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Wellington , Seoul and Manila . Most of those markets had rebounded the day before from Monday 's slide . But unlike the Tokyo %% exchange %% , they failed to extend the rise to a second session . Elsewhere , prices surged for a second day in Frankfurt , closed higher in Zurich , Stockholm and Amsterdam and were broadly lower in Milan , Paris and Brussels . South African gold stocks ended marginally firmer .
exchange.n | 3 | A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the Fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies . `` It was their business decision , '' the official said . Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. %% exchanges %% , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , OCC president and chief operating officer . Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant .
exist.v | 1 | Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to %% exist %% at all . And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .
explain.v | 1 | `` Whatever you say '' . Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered . `` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to %% explain %% that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly . `` Old Crip was n't '' , retorted Cobb tartly . `` He 'll know when you tell him .
express.v | 1 | Where we end our journey is always the same . We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion '' . This was how Alexander Brandel %% expressed %% pure Zionism . It had sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it . In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
feel.v | 1 | 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were %% felt %% with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
feel.v | 1 | Then he began to crawl again . Watson watched the creeping figure . He %% felt %% a spectator interest . Would the man make it or not ? ? If only there was a clock for him to crawl against .
feel.v | 1 | This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh -- a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . Mercer got the blissful needle . When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he %% felt %% the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body . He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately . The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
feel.v | 1 | On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song . It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age . %% Feeling %% suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs . Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human . Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
feel.v | 1 | If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' . I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in . I love you , I hate you , I %% feel %% like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you 're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living . So I went about my business . I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
find.v | 1 | The session failed to enact any new curbs . Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape . Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration %% finds %% itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
find.v | 5 | The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was %% found %% not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
find.v | 1 | The rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . As rescuers pressed their efforts after %% finding %% a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . In Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . Estimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion .

future.n | 3 | The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets . All U.S. %% futures %% exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision . Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are . The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
future.n | 3 | The S&P futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way to get access to all 500 stocks , he says . The Big Board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks . But owning index %% futures %% is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . Stockholders , as a group , can win , because they own a share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock prices . Futures , on the other hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices .
future.n | 3 | `` There was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` Then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P %% futures %% in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath . Shortly after the UAL opening , program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index . The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
future.n | 1 | This ballpark , the Stick , was not a classic baseball stadium -- too symmetrical , too much bald concrete . And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium . But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the %% future %% , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history . The broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick .
future.n | 3 | After two years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index %% futures %% pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first time since October 1987 . The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said . `` Guys were minting money in there today , '' said John Legittino , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago .
go.v | 1 | California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts . The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to California , with an unspecified amount %% going %% to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo . That leaves the state roughly $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion short . A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry .
go.v | 7 | The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're %% going %% to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % .
go.v | 7 | Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? `` You 're not %% going %% to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' In other words , a little volatility never hurt .
go.v | 2 | Then suddenly Ike 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? We 'd get our asses kicked . '' Lucky for Cap , Ike was easygoing and soon %% went %% away , while the shah -- he kept coming back . So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean . We had great success in Somalia .
hold.v | 4 | Medieval philosophers used to %% hold %% the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist , and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all . Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ; it is built into His nature . But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
hold.v | 5 | Lep Group PLC of Britain , which %% holds %% a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . It noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction .
hope.v | 1 | Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . USX and Kobe Steel %% hope %% to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .

It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama , about an %% hour %% outside Tokyo . The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year . The centerpiece of that complex , the Landmark Tower , will be Japan 's tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .

West Germany 's BMW commissioned the Nuremberg post office to test a prototype battery-powered car . The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an %% hour %% and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles .
hour.n | 1 | The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . Bush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . The shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several %% hours %% earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif . The five astronauts , who stowed gear and tested the spacecraft 's steering , said they were unconcerned about the touchy weather expected in the Mojave Desert . Commonwealth leaders issued a declaration giving South Africa six months to deliver on pledges to ease apartheid or face new reprisals .
improve.v | 1 | Thus , subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs , with increasing subsidy and default rates over time . To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect . In contrast , credit programs can be appropriate tools to %% improve %% the operation of capital markets . For example , legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector . Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds .
job.n | 1 | The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60 % or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain . Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130 % in less than two years , the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk . `` There 's a distinct possibility that I may lose my %% job %% over this , '' the employee , Karen Allen , of Floor Covering Resources , Kensington , Md. , recently told a congressional hearing . She said her employer ca n't afford the rate increases , and she fears she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment . For employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread .
job.n | 1 | `` In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . '' What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots . Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's %% job %% classifications into Federal 's .

Oakar , a Democrat from Cleveland , wants a $ 6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . She says it 'd create 600 %% jobs %% and bring Cleveland tourist revenue . HUD says the project does n't qualify , and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money . At the hearing , Rep. Oakar started wailing about `` phoney baloney regulations '' that would stand between her and `` housing for downtown Cleveland . ''

In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras %% joined %% under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor . In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini 's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .

In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . Then , in 1988 , a proposal to %% keep %% better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members .

The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to %% keep %% many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
keep.v | 5 | If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he %% keep %% the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .

As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
kill.v | 1 | The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . I 'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to %% kill %% it at last , for it could never live . The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . `` It 's a big snake , is n't it '' ? ? He said .

It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would %% lead %% a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .

Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . It was her destiny ; ; it was her life .
maintain.v | 1 | Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom %% maintain %% close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
management.n | 2 | Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than 3 % of its shares are owned by employees and %% management %% . Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . ''
management.n | 2 | CMS ENERGY Corp. said %% management %% would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this year . The Dearborn , Mich. , energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant . In addition , CMS reported third-quarter net of $ 68.2 million , or 83 cents a share , up from $ 66.8 million , or 81 cents a share , a year ago .

Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the %% management %% contract . Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr .
management.n | 2 | UAL fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase . Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , UAL 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake . UAL %% management %% was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and British Air was to receive a 15 % stake . The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing . Since then , UAL stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .
management.n | 2 | To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . '' None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater %% management %% equity participation . Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer .

In the end his %% move %% was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan 's autobiography in The American Economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal . But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable . What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen .
move.n | 2 | The Communist Party chief , facing what is viewed as the nation 's worst unrest in nearly 40 years , also said he would allow East Germans to travel abroad more freely , but made clear that the Berlin Wall would remain . A Lebanese Christian alliance accepted an Arab-sponsored proposal aimed at ending Lebanon 's 14-year-old civil war . The %% move %% by the coalition of political parties and Lebanon 's largest Christian militia isolated military chief Aoun , who has rejected the plan , which includes political changes and a Syrian troop withdrawal from Beirut . Baker offered to review Israel 's `` suggested changes '' to his proposal for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks . But the secretary of state advised Israel that attempting to overhaul the five-point plan risked delaying the negotiations aimed at Mideast peace .
move.n | 2 | Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the %% move %% is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover . Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
move.n | 2 | Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL , parent of United Airlines , the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit . Computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . The lightning %% moves %% show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues . The industrial average closed down 18.65 , to 2638.73 .
need.v | 1 | Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' They %% needed %% new crises to generate new grants and contracts . In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency .
need.v | 1 | Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea . The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country 's leader . A White House spokesman said that while Bush would n't alter a longstanding ban on such involvement , `` there 's a clarification %% needed %% '' on its interpretation . India 's Gandhi called for parliamentary elections next month . The balloting , considered a test for the prime minister and the ruling Congress ( I ) Party , comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption .

But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .

Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the U.S. , are still more common in Japan than PCs . In the U.S. , one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of %% network %% . In Japan , about 1 % are linked . `` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says Roger J.

Under current law , it is not financially rational to forgo consumption . Real , aftertax returns from financial assets are on the %% order %% of 1 % or 2 % a year . The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy , the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates , weak capital formation and high capital costs .

She added , however : `` It is not robust by any means .

Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
order.n | 1 | The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under %% orders %% to back out . In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that { UAL } deal , '' he said .

Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .

Net sales for this year 's third quarter were $ 14 million , down from $ 21.4 million last year . The company attributed the decrease in %% part %% to the exclusion of the company 's British sales from the current year 's figures as a result of the subsidiary 's status as a proposed discontinued operation and , in part , to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts . U.K. sales for last year 's quarter were about $ 3 million .
part.n | 1 | Fortunately , an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old . Though I 've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world , I 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s . Most of the land in that and other %% parts %% of the Delta are now owned by second , third or fourth generations of the same families . These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers , people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life . Following World War II , when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families , the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security , no skills in the workplace , no hope for their future except welfare .

A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been %% part %% of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe . Parliament is expected to discuss next month whether to change the law . British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles .

The move , subject to a definitive agreement , is %% part %% of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business . Just last month , a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp.

people.n | 1 | Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio . The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business . But it may amount to little more than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks , and %% people %% familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week . Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions . But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement .

That 's good news for marketers of walking shoes .
people.n | 1 | Sadly , the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral . Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves . The %% people %% of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open , river traffic to increase , government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students . Because we refuse to face the tough answers , the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees , for the media and politicians . Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism , teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance .
people.n | 1 | -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect . The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of President Roh . But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea 's renters say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary %% people %% to buy a home . Some want lower limits on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions on landholdings , high taxation of capital gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based .

The LDP must make a decision immediately ; Lower House elections must take place before June . In the current mood of the Japanese %% people %% , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP , cleansing it of past sins . We must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets . At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out .

Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort . There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban %% people %% . Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .

Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture %% people %% about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .

people.n | 1 | The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . `` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of %% people %% between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % .
plant.n | 2 | At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility . Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` promoter gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the %% plant %% . Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .

Even if that scenario occurs , Westinghouse figures it is prepared . The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear %% plant %% in a decade . John C. Marous , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's AP600 nuclear power plant , which is under development . `` Once we see an order , we expect it 'll be on line by 2000 .
plant.n | 2 | Lynden B. Miller , the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park 's Conservatory Garden , recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street 's Bryant Park : `` Bryant Park , as designed in 1933 , failed as a public space , because it made people feel trapped . By removing the hedges and some walls , the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up . It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and %% plants %% . '' The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began : `` We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed . '' They then addressed the decidedly `` questionable safety of ... a complex garden of endless hiding places .
plant.n | 1 | Detrex Corp. said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio %% plant %% reduced its third-quarter net income by $ 1.9 million . Detrex , which has annual sales of about $ 100 million , declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter . The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year .
plant.n | 1 | Chrysler officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected . General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , said it will idle for yet another week its Linden , N.J. , assembly plant , bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October . GM said the assembly %% plant %% , which builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30 . The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $ 800 rebates on those cars .
plant.n | 1 | SsangYong , which has only about 3 % of the domestic market , will sell about 18,000 of its models this year , twice as many as last year . It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year . The company plans to expand %% plant %% capacity 50 % by 1991 . By then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000 . Hyundai and Daewoo seem unconcerned about the SsangYong threat , but Kia , the scrappy No.3 auto maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its Asia unit .

West German government bonds fell as much as 0.60 point in light , nervous trading . The 7 % Treasury bond due October 1999 ended off 0.60 point to 99.35 to yield 7.09 % , while the 6 3\/4 % notes due 1994 fell 0.35 %% point %% to 97.25 to yield 7.45 % .

point.n | 14 | But Mr. Greenspan , who has repeatedly said the Fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . '' He warned that Fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . Rep. Neal 's bill originally called on the Fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage %% point %% a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter . He altered the wording to win Mr. Greenspan 's endorsement . Even so , his bill is given little chance of passage .
point.n | 14 | Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage %% points %% statewide . The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
point.n | 14 | `` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . '' He seems to be typical of many professional money managers . When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage %% point %% more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . On Friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
point.n | 14 | Corporate Issues Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities . Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 %% point %% with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains . Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week . Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .

'' The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street , suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday 's stock market slide . The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 %% points %% lower at 2638.73 . `` This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist for Mellon Bank . `` It raises questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them .

A minute later it soared 128 %% points %% , then zoomed back down 113 points , 69 below Friday 's close . `` It was crazy , '' said Neil Weisman , general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp . `` It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . ''
policy.n | 1 | To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % . This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls . Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher 's political fortune , Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary %% policy %% . This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind . The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls .

The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15 . After that , it will make a final decision on the %% policy %% . The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start-up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture-capital firm . With $ 2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
policy.n | 1 | What are the facts on this type of lending ? The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching %% policy %% reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector . Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's .
policy.n | 2 | Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? Not likely , I think . Also , some %% policy %% illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . These are not certain , either . Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
policy.n | 1 | But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . President Bush told reporters : `` Whether that { the leadership change } reflects a change in East-West relations , I do n't think so . Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the %% policies %% of Honecker . '' One top U.S. expert on East Germany added : `` There is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we know of , in the East German leadership . '' Indeed , Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups .
position.n | 5 | Debt-Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care , where more physicians are needed most . Now there 's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want : More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they 'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional %% position %% . And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says James Merritt , president of Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , an Irvine , Calif. , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .

Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's %% position %% on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention . He 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
position.n | 3 | General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong %% positions %% in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
position.n | 6 | Says Clayt Wilhite , president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency 's U.S. division , `` Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement , brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser . '' Consider , for example , what happened to Maxwell House coffee . The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership %% position %% in the coffee business . But since returning to advertising , Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers . `` Now , Philip Morris { Kraft General Foods ' parent company } is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House , '' says Dick Mayer , president of the General Foods USA division .
power.n | 1 | If Mr. Gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market , he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future , as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest . These fears were clearly apparent when , last week , Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert , on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding . Yet the Soviet leader 's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal %% power %% , particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30 , do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled ; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika . Indeed , the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform . But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill ?
power.n | 3 | The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road . These `` active suspension systems '' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride . Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces , but active suspension provides %% power %% to counter the jolts . Nissan , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a cheetah , and equates the various parts to the animal 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels . Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .

Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of %% power %% and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can .

The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate , could raise the price tags of such deals by up to 10 % and cool the takeover boom . A bill giving the Transportation Department the %% power %% to block airline leveraged buy-outs cleared a House panel . But Secretary Skinner said he would urge Bush to veto the bill . Housing starts sank 5.2 % in September to a seven-year low .

QUOTABLE : In a speech %% prepared %% for delivery in New York yesterday , retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . I take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .

A company spokesman did n't know Mr. Wakeman 's age . James R.

Arthur B. Crozier , 34 , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John Virtue , who was another of the ousted directors .
president.n | 1 | Last Thursday , PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is . Other large firms , including Bear , Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. , last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own accounts . Kidder made an abrupt about-face on program trading yesterday , after a special meeting between the firm 's %% president %% and chief executive officer , Michael Carpenter , and its senior managers . Just a week ago , Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder , the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year . Index arbitrage , Mr. Carpenter said last week , does n't have a `` negative impact on the market as a whole '' and Kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that .
president.n | 1 | Consequently , abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon , they say . In fact , without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts , the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant . `` More customers may come to us now , '' said James Cayne , %% president %% of Bear Stearns Cos . Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash . They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility .
president.n | 1 | But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second quarter . Mr. Darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted exports will pick up again . `` We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said Daniel Van Dyke , vice %% president %% of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco . `` I ca n't believe it will continue , '' he added , noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive . Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories .
president.n | 1 | One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $ 10 and $ 20 bills that prospects sang `` Here Comes Santa Claus '' when he approached . Paying players at SMU was no casual operation . It involved the athletics director , two different football coaching staffs , and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody , it seemed , but Donald Shields , the university 's %% president %% . There 's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields , having finally learned of the practice , expresses his outrage to Bill Clements , then a university governor ( and now the governor of Texas ! ) and oil man Edwin Cox , chairman of the board of trustees . `` You stay out of it , '' author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying .
president.n | 1 | Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors . Jeffrey Coors , 44 years old , had been %% president %% since 1985 , when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job . But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co. , a small unit of Coors he has run for several years . A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase William Coors 's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors , Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .
president.n | 1 | And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . `` But advertisers would n't think of it , '' she said . Bernard Leser , %% president %% of Conde Nast , added : `` Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues ... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for .
president.n | 1 | If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice %% president %% - engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios . And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . ''
president.n | 1 | Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th . Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week . `` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice %% president %% at T. Rowe Price Associates . `` People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . '' Source : Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
president.n | 3 | No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the %% president %% complained about the rules . However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
president.n | 1 | Robert A. Oswald , chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company , was elected to the additional position of executive vice %% president %% . In addition , Michael W. O'Donnell , executive vice president of a Columbia unit , was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company . The appointments take effect Nov. 1 .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985 , and before that was president of Public Strategies , a Washington consulting firm . He is well-known in Democratic circles , having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale 's 1984 presidential campaign . At Fannie Mae , he will take responsibility for the corporation 's financial and legal areas and will work with David Maxwell , chairman and chief executive officer , and Roger Birk , %% president %% and chief operating officer , on strategic planning . Mr. Johnson , 45 years old , has been a consultant on strategy to Fannie Mae for the past 3 1\/2 years . In an interview , he said Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push to broaden its activities overseas .
president.n | 1 | But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning , dashed those expectations . Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt . `` Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said Roger Early , a vice %% president %% at Federated Investors Inc. , Pittsburgh . `` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . '' Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations .
president.n | 1 | Mr. Wachter , who became his principal adviser , searched galleries in London , Paris and Monaco . And , according to one dealer , Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' Nicholas Hall , the %% president %% of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness '' by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul `` was known to spend a lot of money .

produce.v | 2 | Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' %% produced %% by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally .
promise.v | 1 | CBS expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating . ABC lost $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee . It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience %% promised %% to advertisers . CBS will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events . All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .

He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing %% proved %% to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men 's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
raise.v | 1 | But given the political importance of California , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations . The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help finance this credit and further %% raises %% the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months .
raise.v | 1 | `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by %% raising %% or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .

'' Ultimately , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest %% rates %% on mortgage securities . At the moment , Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments . But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the 59-dealer selling group .

Pinkerton 's world headquarters today is a nondescript , two-story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport . Next , Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton 's rates , which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than California Plant Protection 's average %% rate %% of around $ 8.63 . And he got rid of low-margin businesses that just were n't making money for the company . Mr. Wathen , who says Pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ 8 million in 1987 under American Brands , boasts that he 's made Pinkerton 's profitable again .
rate.n | 1 | `` And where we are is bad . '' Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega , inflation came to 36 % in September alone and is expected to top 1,000 % for the year . That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in July before bringing the %% rate %% down sharply in August and September . Still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2 % to 3 % a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . About $ 70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government .
rate.n | 1 | We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience . Nearby Paul Craig Roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir Alan . Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating %% rates %% , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean , perhaps measured by M-Whatever , but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity .

The preferred shares will carry a floating annual dividend equal to 72 % of the 30-day bankers ' acceptance rate until Dec. 31 , 1994 . Thereafter , the %% rate %% will be renegotiated . Mr. Vaux said that if no agreement is reached , other buyers will be sought by bid or auction . The shares are redeemable after the end of 1994 .

In addition , local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their Hong Kong-dollar exposure . The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered %% rate %% , or Hibor . It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's Eurodollar contract , which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate , the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks . If the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong .
rate.n | 2 | In fact , however , Mr. Reagan 's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something . Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal . Those events continue to move at a %% rate %% , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake . Earlier this week , Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty '' by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk . Hungary is no longer a `` Socialist Peoples '' republic , the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.

Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating %% rate %% , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. . Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
rate.n | 1 | The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London .

Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
rate.n | 1 | In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest %% rates %% as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .

rate.n | 1 | But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest %% rate %% to decline about one-quarter percentage point . The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks .

receive.v | 1 | But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members %% received %% amounted to bribes . Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ( $ 880,000 ) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen .
receive.v | 1 | Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who %% received %% the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .

In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
regard.v | 2 | Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching . We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . A dozen cows mooed sadly and %% regarded %% us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .

He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never %% remember %% whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too . This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .

say.v | 1 | `` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said Lonnie Thompson , a research scientist at Ohio State who dug for and analyzed the ice samples . To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen . These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers %% said %% , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change . Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap , a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age , Mr. Thompson said . Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .

Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich. ) , chairman of the banking committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six months from now , or six years from now , or 26 years from now . '' Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . The FDIC %% said %% it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices . The comptroller 's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987 . The comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending .

say.v | 1 | The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel %% said %% . `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
say.v | 1 | Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time . Environmental lawyers %% say %% virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .

say.v | 1 | The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . The protesters %% said %% their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . '' Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
say.v | 1 | Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . A Labor Department spokesman %% said %% the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .

He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he %% says %% .

The suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . ''
say.v | 1 | Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says .

Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .

Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't %% start %% shipping the computers until early next year . An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said .

state.n | 2 | Since most of the unit 's real estate is in California , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . And , as Mr. Zell says , with Itel and O&Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . It is possible then that Santa Fe 's real estate -- even in a %% state %% imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . But as Drexel analyst Linda Dunn notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years . So despite Wall Street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could be in for a long wait .
state.n | 2 | Indeed , Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature . Obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75 % of the American people these days ( and in fact the president of the United States ) consider themselves environmentalists . As for California being a %% state %% run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from . Perhaps Mr. Reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees , is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth . But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said , `` Is this not Anti-Christ ?
state.n | 2 | No payments would be made this year , but beginning in fiscal 1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $ 500 million until the total liability of $ 1.25 billion is met . The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority . As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 %% states %% in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders . The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp . The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration .
state.n | 2 | Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs . `` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said Quentin Kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee . Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the %% state %% over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes .
state.n | 2 | That total would be important for Drexel . The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 %% states %% reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .
state.n | 2 | Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue . The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' Since the spill last March , Exxon and the %% state %% have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .

It requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest . The most common conflict involves compensation .
state.n | 2 | `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax %% states %% , such as New York or California . But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
state.n | 2 | Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually . The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S. , including income taxes . At the %% state %% and local level , the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate , inheritance and gift taxes , but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest .

system.n | 4 | Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether Mr. Greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . '' The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets . A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking %% system %% . And , by the end of that week , the key federal funds interest rate , which is largely controlled by the Fed , had settled at 8.75 % , barely changed from the level of just under 9 % that prevailed the previous week . Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault .
system.n | 1 | We would be delighted to have such a system in place today . But is it realistic for Congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies ? What if the %% system %% does n't work ? What if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest exchanges can afford it ? Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets .
system.n | 2 | American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission %% systems %% for data , video and voice communications . Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 . The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , said Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T .

The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models . But security %% systems %% , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said . Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details . Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco , the Japan Association of Travel Agents said .
system.n | 2 | New York Times Co. 's third-quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV %% system %% . However , operating profit fell 35 % to $ 16.4 million . The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper .

The defense electronics maker said delivery will begin in October 1991 and run through mid-1995 .
turn.v | 2 | Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . But if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no longer work , and cells normally under control %% turn %% malignant . The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes . Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells , suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves .
turn.v | 4 | There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while %% turning %% away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .

She had begun to %% turn %% back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once . Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .

And I was n't .
value.n | 2 | G-7 consists of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , West Germany , Canada , France and Italy . Tomoshige Kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo , suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand . But , Mr. Kakita added , once U.S. equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially Treasury bonds , whose %% value %% rises when interest rates decline . Mr. Kakita said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen . `` If 135 is broken , some panic will be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen .
value.n | 2 | The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the %% value %% and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument . Scott Miller , an FASB project manager , said that a final rule will be issued before year end . But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months .
value.n | 2 | But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face %% value %% . The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .

Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist %% values %% , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . He was later shown on television , fielding questions .

work.v | 1 | The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan 's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic . The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry , certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices . And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs %% works %% for itself , supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan 's deteriorating image . Instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries .

What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack .

The grocery the youth %% worked %% for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . Reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .
